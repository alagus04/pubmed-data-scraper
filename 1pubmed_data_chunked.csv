39584143,Bacteria and fungi of the lung: allies or enemies?,"Moving from the earlier periods in which the lungs were believed to represent sterile environments, our knowledge on the lung microbiota has dramatically increased, from the first descriptions of the microbial communities inhabiting the healthy lungs and the definition of the ecological rules that regulate its composition, to the identification of the changes that occur in pathological conditions. Despite the limitations of lung as a microbiome reservoir due to the low microbial biomass and abundance, defining its microbial composition and function in the upper and lower airways may help understanding the impact on local homeostasis and its disruption in lung diseases. In particular, the understanding of the metabolic and immune significance of microbes, their presence or lack thereof, in health and disease states could be valuable in development of novel druggable targets in disease treatments. Next-generation sequencing has identified intricate inter-microbe association networks that comprise true mutualistic or antagonistic direct or indirect relationships in the respiratory tract. In this review, the tripartite interaction of bacteria, fungi and the mammalian host is addressed to provide an integrated view of the microbial-host cross-talk in lung health and diseases from an immune and metabolic perspective.","Enrico Garaci, Marilena Pariano, Emilia Nunzi, Claudio Costantini, Marina Maria Bellet, Cinzia Antognelli, Matteo Antonio Russo, Luigina Romani",Frontiers in pharmacology,2024,bacterial-fungal interactions; immunity; metabolism; respiratory bacteriome; respiratory mycobiome,10.3389/fphar.2024.1497173,"San Raffaele Research Center, Sulmona, L'Aquila, Italy.; Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.; Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.; Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.; Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.; Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.; IRCCS San Raffaele Roma, Rome, Italy.; San Raffaele Research Center, Sulmona, L'Aquila, Italy.",N/A,N/A,Journal Article; Review
39578936,Immunoglobulin A Antibodies: From Protection to Harmful Roles.,"Immunoglobulin A (IgA) is the most abundantly produced antibody in humans. IgA is a unique class of immunoglobulin due to its multiple molecular forms, and a defining difference between the two subclasses: IgA1 has a long hinge-region that is heavily O-glycosylated, whereas the IgA2 hinge-region is shorter but resistant to bacterial proteases prevalent at mucosal sites. IgA is essential for immune homeostasis and education. Mucosal IgA plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the mucosal barrier by immune exclusion of pathobionts while facilitating colonization with certain commensals; a large part of the gut microbiota is coated with IgA. In the circulation, monomeric IgA that has not been engaged by antigen plays a discrete role in dampening inflammatory responses. Protective and harmful roles of IgA have been studied over several decades, but a new understanding of the complex role of this immunoglobulin in health and disease has been provided by recent studies. Here, we discuss the physiological and pathological roles of IgA with a special focus on the gut, kidneys, and autoimmunity. We also discuss new IgA-based therapeutic approaches.","Patrick J Gleeson, Niels O S Camara, Pierre Launay, Agnès Lehuen, Renato C Monteiro",Immunological reviews,2024,immunoglobulin A; inflammation; microbiota; mucosal immunity,10.1111/imr.13424,"Center for Research on Inflammation, Paris Cité University, Paris, France.; Department of Immunology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.; Center for Research on Inflammation, Paris Cité University, Paris, France.; Inflamex Laboratory of Excellence, Paris, France.; Center for Research on Inflammation, Paris Cité University, Paris, France.",N/A,N/A,Journal Article; Review

39568773,Gut microbiota in health and disease: advances and future prospects.,"The gut microbiota plays a critical role in maintaining human health, influencing a wide range of physiological processes, including immune regulation, metabolism, and neurological function. Recent studies have shown that imbalances in gut microbiota composition can contribute to the onset and progression of various diseases, such as metabolic disorders (e.g., obesity and diabetes) and neurodegenerative conditions (e.g., Alzheimer's and Parkinson's). These conditions are often accompanied by chronic inflammation and dysregulated immune responses, which are closely linked to specific forms of cell death, including pyroptosis and ferroptosis. Pathogenic bacteria in the gut can trigger these cell death pathways through toxin release, while probiotics have been found to mitigate these effects by modulating immune responses. Despite these insights, the precise mechanisms through which the gut microbiota influences these diseases remain insufficiently understood. This review consolidates recent findings on the impact of gut microbiota in these immune-mediated and inflammation-associated conditions. It also identifies gaps in current research and explores the potential of advanced technologies, such as organ-on-chip models and the microbiome-gut-organ axis, for deepening our understanding. Emerging tools, including single-bacterium omics and spatial metabolomics, are discussed for their promise in elucidating the microbiota's role in disease development.","Yusheng Zhang, Hong Wang, Yiwei Sang, Mei Liu, Qing Wang, Hongjun Yang, Xianyu Li",MedComm,2024,cell death; ferroptosis; gut microbiota; microbiome–gut–organ axis chip; pyroptosis; single‐bacterium omics,10.1002/mco2.70012,Beijing Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Basic Research on Prevention and Treatment for Major Diseases Experimental Research Center China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing China.; School of Traditional Chinese Medicine Southern Medical University Guangzhou China.; Beijing Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Basic Research on Prevention and Treatment for Major Diseases Experimental Research Center China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing China.; Beijing Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Basic Research on Prevention and Treatment for Major Diseases Experimental Research Center China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing China.; School of Life Sciences Beijing University of Chinese Medicine Beijing China.; State Key Laboratory for Quality Ensurance and Sustainable Use of Dao-di Herbs China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing China.; Beijing Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Basic Research on Prevention and Treatment for Major Diseases Experimental Research Center China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing China.,N/A,N/A,Journal Article; Review

Using in vitro human cell lines, we showed that B. eggerthii 1_2_48FAA LOS acts as a weak activator of TLR4-mediated signaling. Moreover, we observed that expression of maturation markers CD40, CD80 and CD86 on monocytes-derived dendritic cells upon B. eggerthii 1_2_48FAA LOS exposure was significantly lower compared to pro-inflammatory Escherichia coli LPS. Taken together, these data provide new structural and biological insights into LPS from gut bacteria, underscoring the importance of structural features in modulating host immunity.","Marta Tiemblo Martín, Magali Coccimiglio, Emanuela Andretta, Luca De Simone Carone, Andrew Bell, Tania Gerpe-Amor, Cristina Di Carluccio, Antonio Molinaro, Yvette van Kooyk, Nathalie Juge, Fabrizio Chiodo, Flaviana Di Lorenzo, Alba Silipo",Carbohydrate polymers,2025,Bacteroides eggerthii; Gut microbiota; Lipopolysaccharide; Mass spectrometry; NMR spectroscopy,10.1016/j.carbpol.2024.122833,"Department of Chemical Sciences and Task Force for Microbiome Studies, University of Naples Federico II, Via Cinthia 4, 80126 Naples, Italy.; Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Department of Molecular Cell Biology and Immunology, Amsterdam Infection and Immunity Institute, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.; Department of Chemical Sciences and Task Force for Microbiome Studies, University of Naples Federico II, Via Cinthia 4, 80126 Naples, Italy.; Department of Chemical Sciences and Task Force for Microbiome Studies, University of Naples Federico II, Via Cinthia 4, 80126 Naples, Italy.; The Gut Microbiome and Health and Food Safety Institute Strategic Programme, Norwich Research Park, Quadram Institute Bioscience, Norwich, UK.; Department of Chemical Sciences and Task Force for Microbiome Studies, University of Naples Federico II, Via Cinthia 4, 80126 Naples, Italy.; Department of Chemical Sciences and Task Force for Microbiome Studies, University of Naples Federico II, Via Cinthia 4, 80126 Naples, Italy; CEINGE-Biotecnologie Avanzate Franco Salvatore, Via Gaetano Salvatore 486, 80145 Napoli, Italy.; Department of Chemical Sciences and Task Force for Microbiome Studies, University of Naples Federico II, Via Cinthia 4, 80126 Naples, Italy; CEINGE-Biotecnologie Avanzate Franco Salvatore, Via Gaetano Salvatore 486, 80145 Napoli, Italy.; Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Department of Molecular Cell Biology and Immunology, Amsterdam Infection and Immunity Institute, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.; The Gut Microbiome and Health and Food Safety Institute Strategic Programme, Norwich Research Park, Quadram Institute Bioscience, Norwich, UK.; Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Department of Molecular Cell Biology and Immunology, Amsterdam Infection and Immunity Institute, Amsterdam, the Netherlands; Institute of Biomolecular Chemistry, National Research Council (CNR), Via Campi Flegrei, 34, Pozzuoli, 80078 Naples, Italy.; Department of Chemical Sciences and Task Force for Microbiome Studies, University of Naples Federico II, Via Cinthia 4, 80126 Naples, Italy; CEINGE-Biotecnologie Avanzate Franco Salvatore, Via Gaetano Salvatore 486, 80145 Napoli, Italy.

39561965,Segmental regulation of intestinal motility by colitis and the adaptive immune system in the mouse ileum and colon.,"Gastrointestinal motility disturbances are a hallmark of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); however, their mechanisms remain unclear. This study utilized a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis mouse model, deficient in mature B and T lymphocytes, to assess intestinal motility and the role of the adaptive immune system in health and IBD. In healthy mice, the absence of adaptive lymphocytes reduced acetylcholine (ACh) sensitivity in the ileum. During colitis, it decreases motility by reducing the intensity and frequency of spontaneous contractions while increasing cholinergic responsiveness. In the proximal colon, adaptive immunity deficiency led to increased contractility and reduced ACh sensitivity in homeostasis, while colitis reduced contractile capacity. In the mid-colon, immune-deficient mice have reduced ACh sensitivity in homeostasis and exacerbated contractile responses during colitis. In the distal colon, adaptive immunity loss reduced contractility in health and cholinergic responsiveness during colitis. These motility alterations were associated with altered acetylcholinesterase and M2/M3 muscarinic receptor expression. Notably, adaptive lymphocyte deficiency resulted in reduced tissue damage and lower TNF-α expression in the colon during colitis paralleling intestinal motility changes. Overall, the adaptive immune system critically regulates motility and inflammation across different intestinal segments in IBD.","Raquel Gomez-Bris, Pilar Rodríguez-Rodríguez, Marina Ortega-Zapero, Santiago Ruvira, Raquel Castillo-González, María Jesús Fernández-Aceñero, Aránzazu Cruz-Adalia, Angela Saez, Silvia-Magdalena Arribas, Jose-Maria Gonzalez-Granado",The American journal of pathology,2024,Inflammatory bowel disease; adaptive immune system; intestinal motility; muscarinic receptors; smooth muscle contractility,10.1016/j.ajpath.2024.10.020,"LamImSys Lab, Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria Hospital 12 de Octubre (imas12), 28041 Madrid, Spain; Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, 28029 Madrid, Spain.; Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, 28029 Madrid, Spain; Food, Oxidative Stress and Cardiovascular Health (FOSCH) Research Group, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, 28049 Madrid, Spain.; LamImSys Lab, Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria Hospital 12 de Octubre (imas12), 28041 Madrid, Spain; Department of Immunology, Ophthalmology and ENT, School of Medicine, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, 28040 Madrid, Spain.; Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, 28029 Madrid, Spain; Food, Oxidative Stress and Cardiovascular Health (FOSCH) Research Group, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, 28049 Madrid, Spain.; Department of Immunology, Ophthalmology and ENT, School of Medicine, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, 28040 Madrid, Spain; Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria Hospital 12 de Octubre (imas12), 28041 Madrid, Spain.; Servicio de Anatomía Patológica, Hospital Clínico San Carlos.

39560665,Selective regulation of IFN-γ and IL-4 co-producing unconventional T cells by purinergic signaling.,"Unconventional T cells, including mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT), natural killer T (NKT), and gamma-delta T (γδT) cells, comprise distinct T-bet+, IFN-γ+ and RORγt+, IL-17+ subsets which play differential roles in health and disease. NKT1 cells are susceptible to ARTC2-mediated P2X7 receptor (P2RX7) activation, but the effects on other unconventional T-cell types are unknown. Here, we show that MAIT, γδT, and NKT cells express P2RX7 and are sensitive to P2RX7-mediated cell death. Mouse peripheral T-bet+ MAIT1, γδT1, and NKT1 cells, especially in liver, co-express ARTC2 and P2RX7. These markers could be further upregulated upon exposure to retinoic acid. Blocking ARTC2 or inhibiting P2RX7 protected MAIT1, γδT1, and NKT1 cells from cell death, enhanced their survival in vivo, and increased the number of IFN-γ-secreting cells without affecting IL-17 production. Importantly, this revealed the existence of IFN-γ and IL-4 co-producing unconventional T-cell populations normally lost upon isolation due to ARTC2/P2RX7-induced death. Administering extracellular NAD in vivo activated this pathway, depleting P2RX7-sensitive unconventional T cells. Our study reveals ARTC2/P2RX7 as a common regulatory axis modulating the unconventional T-cell compartment, affecting the viability of IFN-γ- and IL-4-producing T cells, offering important insights to facilitate future studies into how these cells can be regulated in health and disease.","Calvin Xu, Andreas Obers, Minyi Qin, Alice Brandli, Joelyn Wong, Xin Huang, Allison Clatch, Aly Fayed, Graham Starkey, Rohit D'Costa, Claire L Gordon, Jeffrey Y W Mak, David P Fairlie, Lynette Beattie, Laura K Mackay, Dale I Godfrey, Hui-Fern Koay",The Journal of experimental medicine,2024,N/A,10.1084/jem.20240354,"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, The University of Melbourne at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, Melbourne, Australia.; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, The University of Melbourne at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, Melbourne, Australia.; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, The University of Melbourne at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, Melbourne, Australia.; Department of Anatomy and Physiology, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia.; The Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health , Melbourne, Australia.; The Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health , Melbourne, Australia.; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, The University of Melbourne at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, Melbourne, Australia.; Liver and Intestinal Transplant Unit, Austin Health , Melbourne, Australia.; Liver and Intestinal Transplant Unit, Austin Health , Melbourne, Australia.; DonateLife Victoria , Carlton, Australia.; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, The University of Melbourne at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, Melbourne, Australia.; Centre for Chemistry and Drug Discovery, Institute for Molecular Bioscience, University of Queensland , Brisbane, Australia.; Centre for Chemistry and Drug Discovery, Institute for Molecular Bioscience, University of Queensland , Brisbane, Australia.; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, The University of Melbourne at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, Melbourne, Australia.; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, The University of Melbourne at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, Melbourne, Australia.; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, The University of Melbourne at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, Melbourne, Australia.; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, The University of Melbourne at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, Melbourne, Australia.","Animals; Receptors, Purinergic P2X7; Interferon-gamma; Signal Transduction; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Interleukin-4; Mucosal-Associated Invariant T Cells; Natural Killer T-Cells; Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta",1140126 (National Health and Medical Research Council); DE220100830 (Australian Research Council); RO1 AI14807-01A1 (NIH HHS),Journal Article

39550314,Neuroimmune interactions in the olfactory epithelium: maintaining a sensory organ at an immune barrier interface.,"While primarily a sensory organ, the mammalian olfactory epithelium (OE) also plays a critical role as an immune barrier. Mechanisms governing interactions between the immune system and this specialized chemosensory tissue are gaining interest, in part sparked by the COVID-19 pandemic. Regulated inflammation is intrinsic to normal mucosal healing and homeostasis, but prolonged OE inflammation is associated with persistent loss of smell, belying the intertwining of local mucosal immunology and olfactory function. Evidence supports bidirectional communication between OE cells and the immune system in health and disease. Recent investigations suggest that neuro-immune cross-talk modulates olfactory stem cell behavior and neuronal regeneration dynamics, prioritizing the epithelial-like non-neuronal framework with immune barrier function at the expense of the neurosensory organ in chronic inflammation.","Mohammed N Ullah, Nicholas R Rowan, Andrew P Lane",Trends in immunology,2024,chronic inflammation; horizontal basal cells; immune barrier; olfactory epithelium; regeneration,10.1016/j.it.2024.10.005,"Department of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.; Department of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.; Department of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.

39543383,Hypoxia and collagen deposition in the kidneys infected with Acanthamoeba sp.,"Acanthamoeba spp. are facultative, opportunistic pathogens that are found in diverse environments. In the hosts, they lead to multi-organ disease. Recent studies reported that they may induce changes in the kidneys of hosts. The aim of the study was to determine the influence of Acanthamoeba sp. on hypoxia and collagen deposition in the kidneys of immunocompetent and immunosuppressed mice infected with Acanthamoeba sp. The results strongly suggest that Acanthamoeba sp. induces hypoxia in mice with normal and reduced immune response by increasing gene and/or protein expression of HIF1α as well as HIF2α. Additionally, the activation of these factors is probably induced via NOX2/ROS. Hypoxia promotes vessel formation, and we found that angiogenesis occurs in the kidneys of mice infected with the parasite regardless of their immunological status. The proangiogenic factors released in hypoxic conditions cause modulation and inflammation in the kidney cells, which in turn leads to collagen deposition via TGF-β. This work reveals mechanisms occurring in the hosts infected with Acanthamoeba sp., highlights as well as supports the relevance of pathophysiology in the kidneys in hosts with systematic acanthamoebiasis.","Karolina Kot, Marta Grabowska, Maciej Tarnowski, Patrycja Kupnicka, Patrycja Tomasiak, Danuta Kosik-Bogacka, Natalia Łanocha-Arendarczyk",Scientific reports,2024,Acanthamoeba sp.; Angiogenesis; Collagen; HIFs; Kidneys; TGF-β,10.1038/s41598-024-79848-4,"Department of Biology, Parasitology, and Pharmaceutical Botany, Pomeranian Medical University in Szczecin, Szczecin, Poland. karolina.kot@pum.edu.pl.; Department of Histology and Developmental Biology, Faculty of Health Sciences, Pomeranian Medical University in Szczecin, Szczecin, Poland.; Department of Physiology in Health Sciences, Faculty of Health Sciences, Pomeranian Medical University in Szczecin, Szczecin, Poland.; Department of Biochemistry, Pomeranian Medical University in Szczecin, Szczecin, Poland.; Institute of Physical Culture Sciences, University of Szczecin, Szczecin, Poland.; Department of Biology, Parasitology, and Pharmaceutical Botany, Pomeranian Medical University in Szczecin, Szczecin, Poland.; Department of Biology, Parasitology, and Pharmaceutical Botany, Pomeranian Medical University in Szczecin, Szczecin, Poland.","Acanthamoeba; Animals; Kidney; Mice; Collagen; Amebiasis; Hypoxia; Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit; NADPH Oxidase 2; Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors; Reactive Oxygen Species; Transforming Growth Factor beta",N/A,Journal Article

39537825,Growth hormone-releasing hormone and its analogues in health and disease.,"Growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) and its ability to stimulate the production and release of growth hormone from the pituitary were discovered more than four decades ago. Since then, this hormone has been studied extensively and research into its functions is still ongoing. GHRH has multifaceted roles beyond the originally identified functions that encompass a variety of direct extrapituitary effects. In this Review, we illustrate the different biological activities of GHRH, covering the effects of GHRH agonists and antagonists in physiological and pathological contexts, along with the underlying mechanisms. GHRH and GHRH analogues have been implicated in cell growth, wound healing, cell death, inflammation, immune functions, mood disorders, feeding behaviour, neuroprotection, diabetes mellitus and obesity, as well as cardiovascular, lung and neurodegenerative diseases and some cancers. The positive effects observed in preclinical models in vitro and in vivo strongly support the potential use of GHRH agonists and antagonists as clinical therapeutics.","Riccarda Granata, Sheila Leone, Xianyang Zhang, Iacopo Gesmundo, Charlotte Steenblock, Renzhi Cai, Wei Sha, Ezio Ghigo, Joshua M Hare, Stefan R Bornstein, Andrew V Schally",Nature reviews.

39535569,Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to postoperative cognitive dysfunction in elderly rats dependent on NLRP3 activation.,"Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD), a complication following procedures such as orthopedic surgery, is associated with a worsened prognosis, especially in the elderly population. Several mechanisms have been proposed for communication between the immune system and the brain after surgery. In an experimental tibial fracture (TF) model, we aimed to understand the role of the NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) on oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction as mechanisms underlying POCD in aged and adult rats. Adult or aged male Wistar rats were subjected to the TF model and received intracerebroventricular saline or MCC950 (140 ng/kg), a specific small-molecule inhibitor that selectively blocks activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. We followed the control (sham) and TF groups treated with MCC950 or saline for seven days to determine cognitive function and survival. The prefrontal cortex and hippocampus were isolated for NLRP3 evaluation, cytokine analysis, oxidative stress measurements, myeloperoxidase activity, nitric oxide formation, mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes, and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity. Seven days after TF induction, NLRP3 levels increased in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex in both ages, showed an enhancement in aged rats compared to adults, and experienced a reversal with MCC950 administration. The administration of MCC950 restored memory, IL-1β and IL-10 levels, nitrite/nitrate, lipid peroxidation in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, and preserved catalase activity in the prefrontal cortex in aged rats. At the same age, the complex I activity alteration in both regions and complex II, IV, and SDH in the prefrontal cortex were reversed. In conclusion, NLRP3 activation contributes to POCD development because it is intrinsically involved in mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress after orthopedic surgery in aged rats.","Sandra Bonfante, Martins Back Netto, Aloir Neri de Oliveira Junior, Khiany Mathias, Richard Simon Machado, Larissa Joaquim, Taina Cidreira, Marina Goulart da Silva, Guilherme Cabreira Daros, Lucinéia Gainski Danielski, Fernanda Gava, Isabela da Silva Lemos, Rafaela Tezza Matiola, Emily Córneo, Josiane Somariva Prophiro, Rafael Mariano de Bitencourt, Carlos Henrique Rocha Catalão, Jaqueline da Silva Generoso, Emílio Luiz Streck, Felipe Dal-Pizzol, Tatiana Barichello, Fabricia Petronilho",Metabolic brain disease,2024,Mitochondrial respiratory chain; NLRP3; Oxidative stress; Postoperative cognitive dysfunction,10.1007/s11011-024-01425-5,"Laboratory of Experimental Neurology, Graduate Program in Health Sciences, Health Sciences Unit, University of Southern Santa Catarina, Criciuma, SC, Brazil.; University of South Santa Catarina, Tubarao, SC, Brazil.; University of South Santa Catarina, Tubarao, SC, Brazil.; University of South Santa Catarina, Tubarao, SC, Brazil.; University of South Santa Catarina, Tubarao, SC, Brazil.; University of South Santa Catarina, Tubarao, SC, Brazil.; University of South Santa Catarina, Tubarao, SC, Brazil.; University of South Santa Catarina, Tubarao, SC, Brazil.; University of South Santa Catarina, Tubarao, SC, Brazil.; Laboratory of Experimental Neurology, Graduate Program in Health Sciences, Health Sciences Unit, University of Southern Santa Catarina, Criciuma, SC, Brazil.; Laboratory of Experimental Neurology, Graduate Program in Health Sciences, Health Sciences Unit, University of Southern Santa Catarina, Criciuma, SC, Brazil.; Laboratory of Neurometabolic Diseases, Graduate Program in Health Sciences, Health Sciences Unit, University of Southern Santa Catarina, Criciuma, SC, Brazil.; Laboratory of Neurometabolic Diseases, Graduate Program in Health Sciences, Health Sciences Unit, University of Southern Santa Catarina, Criciuma, SC, Brazil.; Laboratory of Experimental Pathophysiology, Graduate Program in Health Sciences, Health Sciences Unit, University of Southern Santa Catarina, Criciuma, SC, Brazil.; University of South Santa Catarina, Tubarao, SC, Brazil.; University of South Santa Catarina, Tubarao, SC, Brazil.; Department of Neurosciences and Behavioral Sciences, Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of Sao Paulo (USP), Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil.; Laboratory of Experimental Neurology, Graduate Program in Health Sciences, Health Sciences Unit, University of Southern Santa Catarina, Criciuma, SC, Brazil.; Laboratory of Neurometabolic Diseases, Graduate Program in Health Sciences, Health Sciences Unit, University of Southern Santa Catarina, Criciuma, SC, Brazil.; Laboratory of Experimental Pathophysiology, Graduate Program in Health Sciences, Health Sciences Unit, University of Southern Santa Catarina, Criciuma, SC, Brazil.; Laboratory of Experimental Neurology, Graduate Program in Health Sciences, Health Sciences Unit, University of Southern Santa Catarina, Criciuma, SC, Brazil.; Laboratory of Experimental Neurology, Graduate Program in Health Sciences, Health Sciences Unit, University of Southern Santa Catarina, Criciuma, SC, Brazil. fabriciapetronilho@unesc.net.","Animals; NLR Family, Pyrin Domain-Containing 3 Protein; Oxidative Stress; Rats, Wistar; Male; Rats; Postoperative Cognitive Complications; Mitochondria; Aging; Indenes; Sulfonamides; Hippocampus; Furans; Sulfones",N/A,Journal Article
39532835,Entinostat in combination with nivolumab in metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: a phase 2 clinical trial.,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is characterized by low cytotoxic lymphocytes, abundant immune-suppressive cells, and resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). Preclinical PDA models showed the HDAC inhibitor entinostat reduced myeloid cell immunosuppression, sensitizing tumors to ICI therapy. This phase II study combined entinostat with nivolumab (PD1 inhibitor) in patients with advanced PDA (NCT03250273). Patients received entinostat 5 mg orally once weekly for 14-day lead-in, followed by entinostat and nivolumab. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR) by RECIST v1.1. Secondary endpoints included safety, duration of response, progression free-survival and overall survival. Between November 2017 and November 2020, 27 evaluable patients were enrolled. Three showed partial responses (11% ORR, 95% CI, 2.4%-29.2%) with a median response duration of 10.2 months. Median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were, respectively, 1.89 (95% CI, 1.381-2.301) and 2.729 (95% CI, 1.841-5.622) months. Grade ≥3 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 19 patients (63%), including decreased lymphocyte count, anemia, hypoalbuminemia, and hyponatremia. As exploratory analysis, peripheral and tumor immune profiles changes were assessed using CyTOF, mIHC, and RNA-seq. Entinostat increased dendritic cell activation and maturation. Gene expression analysis revealed an enrichment in inflammatory response pathways with combination treatment. Although the primary endpoint was not met, entinostat and nivolumab showed durable responses in a small subset of PDA patients. Myeloid cell immunomodulation supported the preclinical hypothesis, providing a basis for future combinatorial therapies to enhance clinical benefits in PDA.","Marina Baretti, Ludmila Danilova, Jennifer N Durham, Courtney B Betts, Leslie Cope, Dimitrios N Sidiropoulos, Joseph A Tandurella, Soren Charmsaz, Nicole Gross, Alexei Hernandez, Won Jin Ho, Chris Thoburn, Rosalind Walker, James Leatherman, Sarah Mitchell, Brian Christmas, Ali Saeed, Daria A Gaykalova, Srinivasan Yegnasubramanian, Elana J Fertig, Lisa M Coussens, Mark Yarchoan, Elizabeth Jaffee, Nilofer S Azad",Nature communications,2024,N/A,10.1038/s41467-024-52528-7,"Department of Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, USA.; Department of Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, USA.; Department of Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, USA.; Department of Cell, Developmental & Cancer Biology and Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, USA.; Department of Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, USA.; Department of Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, USA.; Department of Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, USA.; Department of Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, USA.; Department of Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, USA.; Department of Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, USA.; Department of Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, USA.; Department of Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, USA.; Department of Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, USA.; Department of Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, USA.; Department of Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, USA.; Department of Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, USA.; Department of Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, USA.; Department of Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, USA.; Department of Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, USA.; Department of Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, USA.; Department of Cell, Developmental & Cancer Biology and Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, USA.; Department of Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, USA.; Department of Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, USA.; Department of Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, USA. nazad2@jhu.edu.","Humans; Female; Male; Middle Aged; Aged; Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal; Pyridines; Nivolumab; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Benzamides; Adult; Progression-Free Survival; Aged, 80 and over; Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors",N/A,"Journal Article; Clinical Trial, Phase II"

Dysregulation of immunoreceptor signalling can therefore lead to a range of diseases, making immunoreceptor-based therapies a promising frontier in biomedicine. A common feature of various immunoreceptors is the basic-residue-rich sequence (BRS), which is a largely unexplored aspect of immunoreceptor signalling. The BRS is typically located in the cytoplasmic juxtamembrane region of immunoreceptors, where it forms dynamic interactions with neighbouring charged molecules to regulate signalling. Loss or gain of the basic residues in an immunoreceptor BRS has been linked to severe human diseases, such as immunodeficiency and autoimmunity. In this Perspective, we describe the role of BRSs in various immunoreceptors, elucidating their signalling mechanisms and biological functions. Furthermore, we highlight pathogenic mutations in immunoreceptor BRSs and discuss the potential of leveraging BRS signalling in engineered T cell-based therapies.","Xiaoshan Shi, Xing He, Chenqi Xu",Nature reviews.

39524457,Development of a Multiple-Epitope-Based Vaccine for Hepatitis C Virus Genotypes 1a and 1b: an in-silico reverse vaccinology approach.,"The Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a blood-transmitted virus responsible for persistent inflammation, presenting a substantial worldwide health challenge. HCV, characterized by a positive-stranded ribonucleic acid genome, possesses an intricate genetic makeup encoding both structural and non-structural proteins, crucial for sustaining its life cycle. The Direct Acting Antivirals have revolutionized the treatment landscape of HCV promoting higher Sustained Virological Response rates. Despite significant advancements in treatment, no vaccines are currently available against HCV. The development of effective HCV vaccines becomes challenging as the genetic diversity of HCV virus and its complex nature of the immune response required for protection. In this work, the immunoinformatics methods were utilized to develop a multiple-epitope-based vaccine towards an effective treatment against the viral HCV polyprotein. The vaccine was constructed by T-cell epitopes extracted from the viral polyprotein of HCV genotypes 1a and 1b. The vaccine was highly antigenic, non-toxic, and non-allergenic. Effective binding of the designed vaccine construct was studied by forming complexes with the human immune Toll-Like Receptors; TLR3 and TLR8. The MD simulation of these receptor-vaccine complexes were performed for 50ns and the immunological simulation of modeled vaccine in presence of receptors for 365 days timeline validated the stability of the constructed vaccine. The in-silico vaccine construct developed from this work might be beneficial as prophylactic measures against the HCV variants, if explored further in in vivo and in vitro methods. Consequently, this research outcome is presumed to have implications in the development of safer and more efficient vaccines for lethal diseases.","Enakshi Das, Mahesh Samantaray, Kajal Abrol, Jayarani Basumatari, Shilpa Sri Pushan, Amutha Ramaswamy",In silico pharmacology,2024,HCV; Immune Simulation; In-silico cloning; MD simulation; Multiple-epitope-based vaccine,10.1007/s40203-024-00275-4,"Department of Bioinformatics, Pondicherry University, Kalapet, Puducherry India.; Department of Bioinformatics, Pondicherry University, Kalapet, Puducherry India.; Department of Bioinformatics, Pondicherry University, Kalapet, Puducherry India.; Department of Bioinformatics, Pondicherry University, Kalapet, Puducherry India.; Department of Bioinformatics, Pondicherry University, Kalapet, Puducherry India.; Department of Bioinformatics, Pondicherry University, Kalapet, Puducherry India.",N/A,N/A,Journal Article

This study investigates the dynamics of immune cell kinetics in DM after myocardial infarction (MI) over time. MI was induced in diabetic and healthy control groups using C57BL/N6 mice, with sacrifices occurring at days 1, 3, 7, and 28 post-MI to collect heart, peripheral blood (PB), spleen, and bone marrow (BM) samples. Cell suspensions from each organ were isolated and analyzed via flow cytometry. Additionally, the endothelial progenitor cell-colony-forming assay (EPC-CFA) was performed using mononuclear cells derived from BM, PB, and the spleen. The results indicated that, despite normal production in BM and the spleen, CD45+ cells were lower in the PB of DM mice at days 1 to 3. Further analysis revealed a reduction in total and pro-inflammatory neutrophils (N1s) in PB at days 1 to 3 and in the spleen at days 3 to 7 in DM mice, suggesting that DM-induced alterations in splenic neutrophils fail to meet the demand in PB and ischemic tissues. Infiltrating macrophages (total, M1, M2) were reduced at day 3 in the DM-ischemic heart, with total and M1 (days 1-3) and M2 (days 3-7) macrophages being significantly decreased in DM-PB compared to controls, indicating impaired macrophage recruitment and polarization in DM. Myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) in the heart were higher from days 1 to 7, which corresponded with the enhanced recruitment of CD8+ cells from days 1 to 28 in the DM-infarcted myocardium. Total CD4+ cells decreased in DM-PB at days 1 to 3, suggesting a delayed adaptive immune response to MI. B cells were reduced in PB at days 1 to 3, in myocardium at day 3, and in the spleen at day 7, indicating compromised mobilization from BM. EPC-CFA results showed a marked decrease in definitive EPC colonies in the spleen and BM from days 1 to 28 in DM mice compared to controls in vitro, highlighting that DM severely impairs EPC colony-forming activity by limiting the differentiation of EPCs from primitive to definitive forms. Taking together, this study underscores significant disruptions in the cardio-spleen-bone marrow immune cell axis following MI in DM, revealing delayed innate and adaptive immune responses along with impaired EPC differentiation.","Amankeldi A Salybekov, Kanat Tashov, Yin Sheng, Ainur Salybekova, Yoshiko Shinozaki, Takayuki Asahara, Shuzo Kobayashi",International journal of molecular sciences,2024,cardio-spleno-bone marrow axis; diabetes; immune cell kinetics; myocardial ischemia,10.3390/ijms252111833,"Kidney Disease and Transplant Center, Shonan Kamakura General Hospital, Kamakura 247-8533, Japan.; Department of Advanced Medicine Science, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara 259-1193, Japan.; Department of Advanced Medicine Science, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara 259-1193, Japan.; Department of Advanced Medicine Science, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara 259-1193, Japan.; Teaching and Research Support Core Center, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara 259-1193, Japan.; Shonan Research Institute of Innovative Medicine, Shonan Kamakura General Hospital, Kamakura 247-8533, Japan.; Kidney Disease and Transplant Center, Shonan Kamakura General Hospital, Kamakura 247-8533, Japan.","Animals; Myocardial Infarction; Spleen; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental; Male; Bone Marrow; Macrophages; Bone Marrow Cells; Myocardium; Neutrophils",grant number 19K08525 and 22K08224.

39518410,COVID-19 and Its Potential Impact on Children Born to Mothers Infected During Pregnancy: A Comprehensive Review.,"Pregnancy is a vulnerable period of time during which pregnant people are prone to infections like COVID-19, which can increase risks for both the mother and fetus. These infections may lead to complications such as preterm birth, developmental delays, and congenital abnormalities. While COVID-19 poses additional risks like placental dysfunction and neonatal infections, studies on long-term effects remain limited. Ongoing research and monitoring are essential to understand and mitigate potential cognitive and developmental challenges in children born to mothers infected with COVID-19. This review aims to guide clinicians in managing these risks throughout childhood. Maternal COVID-19 infection during pregnancy can have significant implications for fetal development, even if the newborn is not infected at birth. The release of inflammatory cytokines may cross the placental barrier, potentially disrupting fetal brain development and increasing the risk of long-term cognitive and behavioral issues, such as ADHD or autism. Placental dysfunction, caused by inflammation or thrombosis, can lead to intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), preterm birth, or hypoxia, affecting both neurological and respiratory health in newborns. Furthermore, a compromised fetal immune system can increase susceptibility to autoimmune conditions and infections. The early diagnosis and management of infections during pregnancy are crucial in mitigating risks to both the mother and fetus. Swift intervention can prevent complications like preterm birth and long-term developmental challenges, ensuring better health outcomes for both the mother and child. Long-term monitoring of children born to mothers infected with COVID-19 is necessary to understand the full extent of the virus's impact. This review evaluates the long-term systemic effects of maternal COVID-19 infection during pregnancy on fetuses, newborns, and children, focusing beyond vertical transmission. It highlights the broader impacts on fetal development, offering insights to help clinicians manage potential issues that may arise later in life.","Cristiana Stolojanu, Gabriela Doros, Melania Lavinia Bratu, Iulia Ciobanu, Krisztina Munteanu, Emil Radu Iacob, Laura Andreea Ghenciu, Emil Robert Stoicescu, Mirabela Dima","Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)",2024,child development; fetal development; maternal COVID-19 effects; placental dysfunction,10.3390/diagnostics14212443,"Doctoral School, 'Victor Babes' University of Medicine and Pharmacy, 300041 Timisoara, Romania.; 'Louis Turcanu' Emergency Hospital for Children, 300011 Timisoara, Romania.; Center for Neuropsychology and Behavioral Medicine, Discipline of Psychology, Faculty of General Medicine, 'Victor Babes' University of Medicine and Pharmacy Timisoara, 300041 Timisoara, Romania.; Department of Anatomy and Embriology, 'Victor Babes' Univeristy of Medicine and Pharmacy, 300041 Timisoara, Romania.; Department of Anatomy and Embriology, 'Victor Babes' Univeristy of Medicine and Pharmacy, 300041 Timisoara, Romania.; Department of Pediatric Surgery, 'Victor Babes' University of Medicine and Pharmacy, 300041 Timisoara, Romania.; Department of Functional Sciences, 'Victor Babes' University of Medicine and Pharmacy Timisoara, 300041 Timisoara, Romania.; Radiology and Medical Imaging University Clinic, 'Victor Babes' University of Medicine and Pharmacy Timisoara, 300041 Timisoara, Romania.; Department of Neonatology, 'Victor Babes' University of Medicine and Pharmacy, 300041 Timisoara, Romania.",N/A,N/A,Journal Article; Review

39514471,Evolution of WHO COVID-19 mask guidelines amid intense demands for rapid advice.,"During a health emergency, there is an urgent need to rapidly develop guidelines that meet minimum quality standards, as exemplified by the development of WHO guidelines on mask use in health care and community settings during the COVID-19 pandemic. Between January 2020 and October 2023, WHO developed 21 guideline updates on the use of masks as part of infection prevention and control (IPC) practices. Guideline developers had to deal with an ever-growing volume of evidence of variable quality. Initially, indirect evidence drawn from other severe respiratory illnesses and established minimum requirements for IPC were used. As direct evidence began to emerge, WHO commissioned a living systematic review on mask use in June 2020, which formed the basis of evidence-to-decision making. As more evidence became available, additional considerations were incorporated into the process of recommendation formulation, including harms, acceptability, feasibility and resource use. Target populations for the mask guidelines expanded to include the general public, including children. A broad range of disciplines supported guideline development, including IPC, epidemiology, infectious diseases, occupational health, engineering, pneumology, paediatrics, and water, sanitation and hygiene, as well as civil society representatives. Additional expertise was engaged in the areas of ventilation and aerobiology to expand the range of perspectives regarding modes of transmission. Despite challenges, the experience of rapidly and regularly updating advice on mask use during an emergency health response has shown that it is possible to apply the minimum standards for ensuring the guideline methodology is trustworthy and transparent, with increasing rigor over time as evidence improves. Overall, the experience of developing guidelines during the COVID-19 pandemic underscores the importance of adapting to evolving evidence, incorporating diverse perspectives, and maintaining transparency to ensure a rigorous methodology and in return guideline trustworthiness and effectiveness.","Nathan Ford, Hannah Hamilton Hurwitz, Roger Chou, Vicky Willet, May Chu, Mitchell J Schwaber, Kathleen Dunn, João Paulo Toledo, Alice Simniceanu, Madison Moon, Rebekah Thomas, Benedetta Allegranzi, April Baller",PLOS global public health,2024,N/A,10.1371/journal.pgph.0003778,"World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland.; World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland.; Pacific Northwest Evidence-based Practice Center and the Department of Medical Informatics and Clinical Epidemiology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon, United States of America.; World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland.; Colorado School of Public Health, Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado, United States of America.; National Center for Infection Control, Israel Ministry of Health, Jerusalem, Israel.; World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland.; World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland.; World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland.; World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland.; World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland.; World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland.; World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland.",N/A,N/A,Journal Article

39511612,Different immunogens and prime-boost vaccination strategies affect the efficacy of recombinant candidate vaccines against pathogenic orthopoxviruses.,"Although not as lethal as variola virus (VARV), the cause of smallpox, monkeypox virus (MPXV) represents a threat to public health, with important infection rates and mortality in several African countries and signs of spreading worldwide. MPXV may establish new reservoirs in non-endemic countries and can be considered a possible biological weapon. Human-to-human MPXV transmission is increasing with a growing susceptibility, coincident with the declining herd immunity against smallpox. The emerging threat of MPXV highlights the urgent need for protection from new zoonotic infections, as mankind is completely unprepared for encounters with new viruses. Preventive vaccination remains the most effective control against orthopoxviruses (OPXVs) such as MPXV and prime-boost vaccination strategies can significantly influence vaccine efficacy and enhance immune responses. Our study aimed at characterizing potential vaccine candidates against OPXV infections in a murine model using DNA, viral and protein recombinant vaccines using different prime-boost regimens. The experiments employed Vaccinia virus (VACV) A33, B5, L1, and A27 envelope proteins as immunogens for both priming and boosting. Priming was carried out using a mixture of four plasmids (4pVAXmix), and boosts employed fowlpox (FWPV) recombinants (4FPmix) and/or the purified recombinant proteins (4protmix), all of them expressing the same antigens.

39505760,Tetracycline and Oxacillin Act Synergistically on Biofilms and Display Increased Efficacy In Vivo Against Staphylococcus aureus.,"Oxacillin (bactericidal) and tetracycline (bacteriostatic) are clinically relevant antibiotics that are routinely prescribed to treat Staphylococcus aureus infections but not conventionally used in combination. There is an urgent need for treatment regimens that can act upon biofilms during infection, associated with chronic infections on indwelling devices, as well as acute planktonic (systemic) infection. Here we show that in an in vitro model oxacillin and tetracycline act synergistically against S. aureus UAMS-1 biofilms, reducing the concentration of both antibiotics necessary to eradicate an established biofilm. Using an in vivo zebrafish larval infection model with S. aureus NewHG, they display improved bacterial clearance compared to each drug alone and can counteract a loss of host phagocytes, an important innate defence against S. aureus. In these cases, the bacteriostatic nature of tetracycline enhances rather than dampens the bactericidal action of oxacillin, although an exact mechanism remains to be elucidated. We suggest a dual therapy could be of clinical use against biofilm-forming S. aureus and has a potential use in patients with a compromised immune system.","Amy K Tooke, Rebecca E Hodges, Josie F Pyrah, Kenneth W Bayles, Stephen A Renshaw, Simon J Foster",Current microbiology,2024,N/A,10.1007/s00284-024-03959-4,"School of Biosciences, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, S10 2TH, UK.; Department of Pathology and Microbiology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE, USA.; School of Biosciences, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, S10 2TH, UK.; Department of Pathology and Microbiology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE, USA.; The Bateson Centre, University of Sheffield, Western Bank, Sheffield, S10 2TH, UK.; School of Biosciences, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, S10 2TH, UK. s.foster@sheffield.ac.uk.","Biofilms; Oxacillin; Staphylococcus aureus; Animals; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Zebrafish; Tetracycline; Staphylococcal Infections; Drug Synergism; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Humans; Disease Models, Animal",MRNO2995X/1 (MRC); P01 AI083211 (NIAID NIH HHS); 1945736 (BBSRC); P01-AI83211 (NIH HHS); MR/R001111/1 (MRC),Journal Article
39505366,Characterisation of LGP2 complex multitranscript system in humans: role in the innate immune response and evolution from non-human primates.,"Retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs), including RIG-I, MDA5 and LGP2, recognize viral RNA to mount an antiviral interferon (IFN) response RLRs share three different protein domains: C-terminal domain, DExD/H box RNA helicase domain, and an N-terminal domain with two tandem repeats (CARDs). LGP2 lacks tandem CARD and is not able to induce an IFN response. However, LGP2 positively enhances MDA5 and negatively regulates RIG-I signaling. In this study, we determined the LGP2 alternative transcripts in humans to further comprehend the mechanism of its regulation, their evolutionary origin, and the isoforms functionallity. The results showed new eight alternative transcripts in the samples tested. The presence of these transcripts demonstrated that the main mechanisms for the regulation of LGP2 expression are both by insertion of introns and by the loss of exons. The phylogenetic analysis of the comparison between sequences from exon 1 to exon 3 of humans and those previously described in non-human primates showed three well-differentiated groups (lineages) originating from gorillas, suggesting that the transspecies evolution has been maintained for 10 million years. The corresponding protein models (isoforms) were also established, obtaining four isoforms: one complete and three others lacking the C-terminal domain or this domain and the partial or total He2 Helicase domain, which would compromise the functionality of LGP2. In conclusion, this is the first study that elucidate the large genomic organization and complex transcriptional regulation of human LGP2, its pattern of sequence generation, and a mode of evolutionary inheritance across species.","Jorge Martinez-Laso, Isabel Cervera, Marina S Martinez-Carrasco, Veronica Briz, Celia Crespo-Bermejo, Clara Sánchez-Menéndez, Guiomar Casado-Fernández, Montserrat Torres, Mayte Coiras",Human molecular genetics,2024,LGP2; RLRs; alternative RNA splicing; transpecies evolution,10.1093/hmg/ddae155,"Immunogenetics Unit, National Center of Microbiology, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Ctra Majadahonda-Pozuelo K2,2, Majadahonda, Madrid 28220, Spain.; Immunogenetics Unit, National Center of Microbiology, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Ctra Majadahonda-Pozuelo K2,2, Majadahonda, Madrid 28220, Spain.; Immunogenetics Unit, National Center of Microbiology, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Ctra Majadahonda-Pozuelo K2,2, Majadahonda, Madrid 28220, Spain.; Viral Hepatitis Reference and Research Laboratory, National Center of Microbiology, Institute of Health Carlos III, Majadahonda, 28220, Madrid, Spain.; Viral Hepatitis Reference and Research Laboratory, National Center of Microbiology, Institute of Health Carlos III, Majadahonda, 28220, Madrid, Spain.; Immunopathology and Viral Reservoir Unit, National Center of Microbiology, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Majadahonda, 28220, Madrid, Spain.; Immunopathology and Viral Reservoir Unit, National Center of Microbiology, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Majadahonda, 28220, Madrid, Spain.; Immunopathology and Viral Reservoir Unit, National Center of Microbiology, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Majadahonda, 28220, Madrid, Spain.; Immunopathology and Viral Reservoir Unit, National Center of Microbiology, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Majadahonda, 28220, Madrid, Spain.",N/A,PI22CIII/00059 (Strategic Action in Health of the Instituto de Salud Carlos III); CB21/13/00015 (CIBERINFEC),Journal Article

Below, we discuss recent literature that has provided insight into the role of BATF2 as a transcriptional regulator of immune responses in health and disease, including the cell types that express BATF2, the different diseases in which the immunomodulatory effects of BATF2 have been shown to play a role, and the molecular mechanisms through which BATF2 is thought to exert those effects. In doing so, we highlight that the immunological effects of BATF2 are highly context-dependent, and we point out overlap between the mechanisms of action of BATF2 in infectious disease and non-infectious disease. We also discuss areas of interest for future research, the clinical relevance of better understanding BATF2 function, and potential strategies for therapeutic modulation of BATF2.","Rick van der Geest, Janet S Lee",Journal of leukocyte biology,2024,BATF2; Immune response; Infectious diseases; Inflammation; Transcription factor,10.1093/jleuko/qiae245,"Acute Lung Injury Center of Excellence, Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.; Acute Lung Injury Center of Excellence, Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.",N/A,N/A,Journal Article

39503321,Choroid plexus as a mediator of CNS inflammation in multiple sclerosis.,"The pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis (MS) remains poorly understood despite decades of tremendous research efforts. Advances in neuroradiography coupled with availability of unbiased approaches including spatial transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and lipidomics that are compatible with brain and fluid specimens from patients raise hope that discovery of novel disease drivers is on the horizon. Once thought to be little more than salty bathwater, our modern understanding of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) suggests the CSF as a compelling, critical regulator of brain function in health and disease. Recent studies in the field have reinvigorated interest in CSF as a medium to better understand MS and to deliver disease-modifying therapies. In turn, the choroid plexus, an epithelial tissue located within each brain ventricle that regulates CSF and forms a key blood-CSF barrier, is uniquely positioned to orchestrate neuroinflammation associated with MS. In this perspective review, we will discuss what is known about the choroid plexus as a conductor of immune responses and how it may propagate neuroinflammation associated with MS via the CSF.","Alexandra Hochstetler, Maria K Lehtinen","Multiple sclerosis (Houndmills, Basingstoke, England)",2024,Animal model; Biomarkers; Immunology; Multiple sclerosis,10.1177/13524585241292974,"Department of Pathology, Boston Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Department of Pathology, Boston Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.",N/A,N/A,Journal Article; Review

39502251,From inflammation to immune regulation: The dual nature of dietary lectins in health and disease.,"Beans, vegetables, fruits, and mushrooms offer a delightful array of fragrances and an abundance of nutrients, including essential vitamins, minerals, protein rich in vital amino acids, and omega-3 fatty acids. However, they may also contain lectins, carbohydrate-binding proteins with potential health risks. While some lectins exhibit stability and resistance to digestion, posing threats to gastrointestinal integrity and immune function, others, such as those from butterfly peas and pink bauhinia, show immunomodulatory properties that could bolster immune responses. While some lectins, such as phytohemagglutinin, have been associated with inflammatory responses and autoimmune disorders, others, such as wheat lectin, have shown potential benefits in nutrient absorption. Additionally, mushroom lectins, while generally nontoxic, exhibit immunomodulatory properties with implications for immune health. Despite their potential benefits, challenges remain in understanding lectin dosages, administration routes, and mechanisms of action. Further research is needed to elucidate the intricate roles of dietary lectins in immune function and autoimmune disorders. This review surveys the immunomodulatory effects of dietary lectins from plants and mushrooms, shedding light on their mechanisms of action. From inflammation modulation to potential autoimmune implications, the diverse roles of dietary lectins have been explored, highlighting avenues for future investigations and therapeutic exploration.","Emadeldin H E Konozy, Makarim Elfadil M Osman",Heliyon,2024,Anti-inflammatory; Antinutritional; Autoimmune; Beans; Lectins; Mushrooms; Pro-inflammatory; Vegetables,10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e39471,"Biotechnology Department, Africa City of Technology, Khartoum, Sudan.; Biotechnology Department, Africa City of Technology, Khartoum, Sudan.",N/A,N/A,Journal Article; Review

However, their potential to support vaccine readiness remains underexplored. This paper addresses this gap by investigating the opinions and preferences of ethnic minority community members who attended a health information session regarding community-delivered vaccine messaging. The study explored the perceptions and willingness to engage in community-led communication efforts about vaccination, focusing on COVID-19 booster vaccines. In-depth interviews were conducted between November and December 2023 with individuals from ethnic minority communities in Central Eastern Sydney who attended an information session about COVID-19 boosters. Four key themes emerged from speaking to this specific group, highlighting diverse communication preferences and intentions. Participants emphasized obtaining vaccine-related knowledge from various sources, particularly through interpersonal discussions. Trusted voices like general practitioners (GPs) and targeted media campaigns were deemed to be crucial. Recommendations included leveraging community champions and establishing a central body for efficient vaccination campaign management in multicultural communities. Personal engagement through community discussions was stressed, with inclusive spaces recommended in various settings. Effective strategies include transparent communication, credible health professional endorsement, and addressing concerns with balanced responses. The findings accentuate the potential effectiveness of grassroots, community-centric initiatives in promoting informed vaccine messaging, countering misinformation, and engaging communities in meaningful health dialogs. Further research on tailored communication and strategic partnerships could enhance this initiative and promote sustained health literacy within ethnic minority communities.","Joshua Karras, Mia Harrison, Dina Petrakis, Ellen Gore, Holly Seale",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,2024,COVID-19; attitudes; communication; community; immunization; pandemic; vaccine,10.1080/21645515.2024.2423469,"School of Population Health, UNSW, Sydney, Australia.; Centre for Social Research in Health (CSRH), UNSW, Sydney, Australia.; CEO's Directorate, Ethnic Community Services Co-Operative, Sydney, Australia.; CEO's Directorate, Ethnic Community Services Co-Operative, Sydney, Australia.; School of Population Health, UNSW, Sydney, Australia.","Adult; Aged; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Young Adult; Communication; COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Ethnic and Racial Minorities; Health Communication; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Vaccination; Adolescent; Aged, 80 and over",N/A,Journal Article

39497142,Shared and unique patterns of autonomous human endogenous retrovirus loci transcriptomes in CD14 + monocytes from individuals with physical trauma or infection with COVID-19.,"Since previous studies have suggested that the RNAs of human endogenous retrovirus (HERV) might be involved in regulating innate immunity, it is important to investigate the HERV transcriptome patterns in innate immune cell types such as CD14 + monocytes. Using single cell RNA-seq datasets from resting or stimulated PBMCs mapped to 3,220 known discrete autonomous proviral HERV loci, we found individual-specific variation in HERV transcriptomes between HERV loci in CD14 + monocytes. Analysis of paired datasets from the same individual that were cultured in vitro with LPS or without (i.e. control) revealed 36 HERV loci in CD14 + monocytes that were detected only after activation. To extend our analysis to in vivo activated CD14 + monocytes, we used two scRNA-seq datasets from studies that had demonstrated activation of circulating CD14 + monocytes in patients with physical trauma or patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infections. For direct comparison between the trauma and COVID-19 datasets, we first analyzed 1.625 billion sequence reads from a composite pangenome control of 21 normal individuals. Comparison of the sequence read depth of HERV loci in the trauma or COVID-19 samples to the pangenome control revealed that 39 loci in the COVID-19 and 11 HERV loci in the trauma samples were significantly different (Mann-Whitney U test), with 9 HERV loci shared between the COVID-19 and trauma datasets. The capacity to compare HERV loci transcriptome patterns in innate immune cells, like CD14 + monocytes, across different pathological conditions will lead to greater understanding of the physiological role of HERV expression in health and disease.","Hyunmin Koo, Casey D Morrow",Retrovirology,2024,Autonomous HERV transcriptome; CD14+monocytes; COVID-19; Innate immunity; Pangenome; ScRNA-seq,10.1186/s12977-024-00652-z,"Department of Genetics Hugh Kaul Precision Medicine Institute, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, United States of America. khmkhm87@uab.edu.; Department of Cell, Developmental and Integrative Biology Hugh Kaul Precision Medicine Institute, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, United States of America. caseym@uab.edu.","Humans; Endogenous Retroviruses; COVID-19; Lipopolysaccharide Receptors; Monocytes; Transcriptome; SARS-CoV-2; Wounds and Injuries; Immunity, Innate; Male; Female; Genetic Loci",N/A,Journal Article

Unlike other urogenital cancers, its pathophysiology and therapeutic targets remain poorly understood, particularly regarding the immune response to the tumor microenvironment. This study aims to investigate immune cell infiltration profiles, dendritic cell maturation, and lymphocyte apoptosis in both HPV-positive and HPV-negative PSCC. Clinical and histopathological data, along with peripheral blood and tumor tissue samples, were collected from 30 patients (66.6% were HPV-positive and 33.3% HPV-negative), with an additional 19 healthy donors serving as controls. Tumor-infiltrating immune cells were analyzed following enzymatic digestion of tumor tissue, enabling detailed phenotypic characterization. A simulated tumor microenvironment was created using supernatants derived from primary cultures of HPV-positive PSCC tumors. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated and differentiated into dendritic cells (Mo-DCs) for further phenotyping and lymphoproliferation assays. Lymphocytes from healthy donors and patients were exposed to tumor culture supernatants to evaluate apoptosis induced by the tumor microenvironment. Results showed that HPV-positive tumors exhibited lower T lymphocyte frequencies compared to HPV-negative tumors. Additionally, patients infected with high-risk HPV demonstrated reduced maturation rates of Mo-DCs and decreased expression of co-stimulatory molecules on these cells compared to healthy donors. Furthermore, Mo-DCs from hrHPV-positive patients showed impaired lymphoproliferation capacity relative to controls, while HPV-negative patients exhibited a trend towards reduced lymphoproliferative ability. Regarding the simulated tumor microenvironment, lymphocytes from healthy donors underwent apoptosis, contrasting with patients' lymphocytes, which showed increased viability when cultured with tumor supernatants. These results underscore the impact of HPV infection on T lymphocyte infiltration, Mo-DC maturation, and lymphocyte survival in PSCC, offering critical insights for advancing our understanding of the tumor microenvironment and guiding the development of immunotherapy strategies.","Sulayne Janayna Araujo Guimarães, André Alvares Marques Vale, Mirtes Castelo Branco Rocha, Ana Luiza de Araújo Butarelli, Jenilson Mota da Silva, Amanda Jordão Silva de Deus, Leudivan Nogueira, Ronald Wagner Pereira Coelho, Silma Regina Pereira, Ana Paula Silva Azevedo-Santos",Frontiers in oncology,2024,HPV-related cancer; cancer immunomodulation; costimulatory molecules; dendritic cells; urological carcinoma,10.3389/fonc.2024.1463445,"Postgraduate Program in Health Science, Federal University of Maranhão, São Luís, Brazil.; Postgraduate Program in Health Science, Federal University of Maranhão, São Luís, Brazil.; Laboratory of Immunology Applied to Cancer, Department of Physiological Sciences, Biological and Health Sciences Center, Federal University of Maranhão, São Luís, MA, Brazil.; Postgraduate Program in Health Science, Federal University of Maranhão, São Luís, Brazil.; Postgraduate Program in Health Science, Federal University of Maranhão, São Luís, Brazil.; Postgraduate Program in Health Science, Federal University of Maranhão, São Luís, Brazil.; Maranhense Institute of Oncology Aldenora Bello, São Luís, Brazil.; Maranhense Institute of Oncology Aldenora Bello, São Luís, Brazil.; Laboratory of Genetics and Molecular Biology, Department of Biology, Biological and Health Sciences Center, Federal University of Maranhão, São Luís, MA, Brazil.; Laboratory of Immunology Applied to Cancer, Department of Physiological Sciences, Biological and Health Sciences Center, Federal University of Maranhão, São Luís, MA, Brazil.",N/A,N/A,Journal Article

As histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, SCFAs alter gene expression to enhance the expression of critical regulators of B cell growth. In particular, microbiota SCFAs increase the production of acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and fatty acids in B cells, which provide the energy and building blocks needed for the growth of plasma B cells. SCFAs play a significant role in promoting the involvement of B cells in host immunity during both homeostatic conditions and disease states. In this context, SCFAs stimulate B-cell activation and promote the differentiation of plasma B cells in response to B cell receptor (BCR)-activating antigens or co-stimulatory receptor ligands. The result may be increased production of IgA. Microbiota SCFAs were found to lower both overall and antigen-specific IgE levels, indicating their potential to mitigate IgE-related allergic reactions, much like their effect on class-switch recombination (CSR) towards IgG and IgA. Therefore, in the future, the therapeutic advantage should be to use specific and diffusible chemicals, such as SCFAs, which show a strong immunoregulatory function of B cells. This review focuses on the role of microbiota-produced SCFAs in regulating B cell development and antibody production, both in health and diseases.","Shengming Qu, Yihang Gao, Jingru Ma, Qingzhu Yan",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2023,B cells; GPCR; HDAC; Immune modulation; Immunoglobulin; Microbiota; SCFAs,10.1016/j.biopha.2023.115773,"Department of Dermatology, the Second Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun 130000, China.; Department of Clinical Laboratory, the Second Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun 130000, China.

39491141,Does messaging matter? A registered report on appearance-versus health-based message framing in exercise appeals targeted towards women.,"Prospect theory proposes that message framing differentially impacts the likelihood of engaging in health-related behaviors. Specifically, gain-framed messages that highlight the benefits of engaging in a behavior are more effective at promoting preventative behaviors than loss-framed messages highlighting the costs associated with a lack of engagement. Research suggests that gain-framed messages may more successfully reduce psychological reactance compared to loss-framed messages, which in turn, may promote behavioral change. However, reactance as a mechanism has been largely overlooked in the literature and support for this hypothesis is mixed. These conflicting results may be due to additional factors, such as outcomes of the targeted behavior (health vs. appearance) and goal orientation. Therefore, the present study examined whether message framing (gain-vs. loss-framing) and the fit between a health message's outcomes of focus (i.e., health vs. appearance) and an individual's goal orientation predict psychological reactance, and in turn, cognitive and behavioral outcomes related to exercise.","Kimberly R More, Curt More, Kayla A Burd, Aikaterini Mentzou, L Alison Phillips",Psychology of sport and exercise,2023,Behavioral intentions; Exercise; Goals; Health behavior; Message framing; Risk communication,10.1016/j.psychsport.2023.102555,"Department of Psychology, University of Dundee, Dundee, Scotland, UK.

39489885,A Study on How Libraries Operate as Health Spaces in the United States.,"A health space is any physical, social, or virtual space that supports building health literacy skills, promotes health behavior, preventive health, and wellbeing, or provides health care, health information, or health or social services. To move the needle on health, especially preventive health, a focus on non-traditional health spaces is critical. Libraries serve various community needs such as food distribution, health literacy, education, immunization, and health screenings. This study explores the extent to which libraries are equipped to function as a health space. A convergent mixed-methods approach was utilized; 234 library personnel were randomly recruited using data from the 2017 Public Libraries Survey to complete a survey and 24 semi-structured follow-up interviews were conducted. Our findings support that libraries function as a health space in multiple ways including providing important health and social programming and services to patrons. They help meet patron's health information needs by leveraging the expertise of community partners and incorporating valuable input from patrons in programming decisions. However, the capacity of libraries to carry out these health initiatives varies, in particular due to limited staff expertise in health-related topics and structural issues (e.g., funding). Our research emphasizes the need to integrate organizational health literacy attributes into library operations, specifically by (1) streamlining strategic partnerships with community experts in libraries in high-need areas to extend their limited resources, and (2) incorporating health literacy into missions and operations to draw necessary financial and personnel support to overcome salient challenges (i.e., funding and staff training).","Sasha A Fleary, Patrece L Joseph, Somya Rastogi, Tienna Fenton, Venya Srivastava",Journal of community health,2024,Community health; Health space; Libraries; Organizational health literacy,10.1007/s10900-024-01403-z,"City University of New York Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy, New York, NY, 10027, USA.

Reliable analysis of AIRR-seq data depends on accurate rearranged immunoglobulin (Ig) sequence alignment. Various Ig sequence aligners exist, but there is no unified benchmarking standard representing the complexities of AIRR-seq data, obscuring objective comparisons of aligners across tasks. Here, we introduce GenAIRR, a modular simulation framework for generating Ig sequences alongside their ground truths. GenAIRR realistically simulates the intricacies of V(D)J recombination, somatic hypermutation, and an array of sequence corruptions. We comprehensively assessed prominent Ig sequence aligners across various metrics, unveiling unique performance characteristics for each aligner. The GenAIRR-produced datasets, combined with the proposed rigorous evaluation criteria, establish a solid basis for unbiased benchmarking of immunogenetics computational tools. It sets up the ground for further improving the crucial task of Ig sequence alignment, ultimately enhancing our understanding of adaptive immunity.","Thomas Konstantinovsky, Ayelet Peres, Pazit Polak, Gur Yaari",Briefings in bioinformatics,2024,AIRR-seq; V(D)J recombination; benchmarking; immunoglobulin; sequence alignment; somatic hypermutation,10.1093/bib/bbae556,"Faculty of Engineering, Bar Ilan University, 5290002 Ramat Gan, Israel.; Faculty of Engineering, Bar Ilan University, 5290002 Ramat Gan, Israel.; Faculty of Engineering, Bar Ilan University, 5290002 Ramat Gan, Israel.; Faculty of Engineering, Bar Ilan University, 5290002 Ramat Gan, Israel.",Sequence Alignment; Humans; Immunoglobulins; Computational Biology; V(D)J Recombination; Adaptive Immunity; Software; Algorithms,"2940/21 (ISF); 1001576181/0004941 (Ministry of Innovation, Science & Tecnology)",Journal Article; Comparative Study

Accordingly, nephrocytes represent a preferred invertebrate model for human glomerular disease. Here, we established a method for cell-specific isolation of the two types of Drosophila nephrocytes, garland and pericardial cells, from animals of different developmental stages and ages. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics and RNA-Seq-based transcriptomics were applied to characterise the proteome and transcriptome of the respective cells in an integrated and complementary manner. We observed characteristic changes in the proteome and transcriptome due to cellular ageing. Furthermore, functional enrichment analyses suggested that larval and adult nephrocytes, as well as garland and pericardial nephrocytes, fulfil distinct physiological functions. In addition, the pericardial nephrocytes were characterised by transcriptomic and proteomic profiles suggesting an atypical energy metabolism with very low oxidative phosphorylation rates. Moreover, the nephrocytes displayed typical signatures of extensive immune signalling and showed an active antimicrobial response to an infection. Factor-specific comparisons identified novel candidate proteins either expressed and secreted by the nephrocytes or sequestered by them. The data generated in this study represent a valuable basis for a more specific application of the Drosophila model in analysing renal cell function in health and disease.","Heiko Meyer, Judith Bossen, Maren Janz, Xenia Müller, Sven Künzel, Thomas Roeder, Achim Paululat",Communications biology,2024,N/A,10.1038/s42003-024-07062-z,"Department of Zoology & Developmental Biology, University of Osnabrück, 49076, Osnabrück, Germany.; University of Kiel, Zoology, Molecular Physiology, 24098, Kiel, Germany.; Department of Zoology & Developmental Biology, University of Osnabrück, 49076, Osnabrück, Germany.; University of Kiel, Zoology, Molecular Physiology, 24098, Kiel, Germany.; Max-Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology, Plön, Germany.; University of Kiel, Zoology, Molecular Physiology, 24098, Kiel, Germany. troeder@zoologie.uni-kiel.de.; Department of Zoology & Developmental Biology, University of Osnabrück, 49076, Osnabrück, Germany. achim.paululat@uos.de.",Animals; Proteome; Transcriptome; Proteomics; Gene Expression Profiling; Drosophila melanogaster; Drosophila Proteins; Drosophila; Podocytes,"PA 517/12-1; PA 517/12-2 (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research Foundation)); SFB 944, TP7; SFB 1557, TP12 (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research Foundation)); HA 6421/4-1 (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research Foundation)); SFB 944, TP21 (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research Foundation)); SFB 1182, TP2 (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research Foundation))",Journal Article

39475070,Multi-Target Peptide Nanofiber Immunotherapy Diminishes Complement Anaphylatoxin Activity in Acute Inflammation.,"The anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a are products of the complement cascade that play important and interrelated roles in health and disease. Both are potential targets for anti-inflammatory active immunotherapies in which a patient's own immune system is stimulated to produce therapeutic immune responses against problematic self-molecules. However, the complex and time-dependent interrelations between the two molecules make dual targeting challenging. To investigate a dual-target active immunotherapy against C3a and C5a and to systematically study the effect of varied degrees of responses against both targets, the study employed self-assembled peptide immunogens capable of displaying a broad range of epitope compositions and Design-of-Experiments (DoE) approaches. Peptide nanofibers contained B-cell epitopes of C3a and C5a in defined quantities, and intranasal immunization raised systemic and mucosal immunity against each target. In a lipopolysaccharide-induced model of sepsis, increasing anti-C5a responses are protective, whereas increasing anti-C3a responses are detrimental, and survival rates are negatively correlated with anti-C3a/anti-C5a IgG titer ratio. This work highlights the interplay between the two molecules by making use of a modular, defined, and easily adjusted biomaterial-based active immunotherapy platform.","Helena Freire Haddad, Emily F Roe, Vinicius Xie Fu, Elizabeth J Curvino, Joel H Collier",Advanced healthcare materials,2024,immune engineering; immunoengineering; immunotherapy; self‐assembly; supramolecular,10.1002/adhm.202402546,"Department of Biomedical Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, 27708, USA.; Department of Biomedical Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, 27708, USA.; Department of Biomedical Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, 27708, USA.; Department of Biomedical Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, 27708, USA.; Department of Biomedical Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, 27708, USA.",N/A,DGE-1644868 (National Science Foundation); 1 R01 AI172151 (NIH HHS),Journal Article

39472902,Molecular mechanisms and therapeutic significance of Tryptophan Metabolism and signaling in cancer.,"Tryptophan (Trp) metabolism involves three primary pathways: the kynurenine (Kyn) pathway (KP), the 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin, 5-HT) pathway, and the indole pathway. Under normal physiological conditions, Trp metabolism plays crucial roles in regulating inflammation, immunity, and neuronal function. Key rate-limiting enzymes such as indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), Trp-2,3-dioxygenase (TDO), and kynurenine monooxygenase (KMO) drive these metabolic processes. Imbalances in Trp metabolism are linked to various cancers and often correlate with poor prognosis and adverse clinical characteristics. Dysregulated Trp metabolism fosters tumor growth and immune evasion primarily by creating an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Activation of the KP results in the production of immunosuppressive metabolites like Kyn, which modulate immune responses and promote oncogenesis mainly through interaction with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). Targeting Trp metabolism therapeutically has shown significant potential, especially with the development of small-molecule inhibitors for IDO1, TDO, and other key enzymes. These inhibitors disrupt the immunosuppressive signals within the TME, potentially restoring effective anti-tumor immune responses. Recently, IDO1 inhibitors have been tested in clinical trials, showing the potential to enhance the effects of existing cancer therapies. However, mixed results in later-stage trials underscore the need for a deeper understanding of Trp metabolism and its complex role in cancer. Recent advancements have also explored combining Trp metabolism inhibitors with other treatments, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, to enhance therapeutic efficacy and overcome resistance mechanisms. This review summarizes the current understanding of Trp metabolism and signaling in cancer, detailing the oncogenic mechanisms and clinical significance of dysregulated Trp metabolism. Additionally, it provides insights into the challenges in developing Trp-targeted therapies and future research directions aimed at optimizing these therapeutic strategies and improving patient outcomes.","Jing Yan, Di Chen, Zi Ye, Xuqiang Zhu, Xueyuan Li, Henan Jiao, Mengjiao Duan, Chaoli Zhang, Jingliang Cheng, Lixia Xu, Hongjiang Li, Dongming Yan",Molecular cancer,2024,Cancer; Clinical characteristics; Expression changes; Targeted therapies; Tryptophan metabolism,10.1186/s12943-024-02164-y,"Department of MRI, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Henan, Zhengzhou, China.; Department of Neurosurgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, China.; Department of Scientific Research, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, China.; Department of Neurosurgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, China.; Department of Neurosurgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, China.; Department of Neurosurgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, China.; Department of MRI, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Henan, Zhengzhou, China.; Department of MRI, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Henan, Zhengzhou, China.; Department of MRI, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Henan, Zhengzhou, China.; Department of Infectious Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, China. mslixiaxu@163.com.; Department of Neurosurgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, China. hongjianglineuron@163.com.; Department of Neurosurgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, China. mrdmyan@163.com.","Humans; Tryptophan; Neoplasms; Signal Transduction; Animals; Tumor Microenvironment; Kynurenine; Indoleamine-Pyrrole 2,3,-Dioxygenase; Disease Susceptibility; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; Tryptophan Oxygenase; Molecular Targeted Therapy","YXKC2022061 (the Excellent Youth Talent Cultivation Program of Innovation in Health Science and Technology of Henan Province); 2024M752952 (the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); LHGJ20230239 (the Henan Medical Science and Technology Joint Building Program); 82102149, 82472069, and 82401623 (China National Natural Science Foundation)",Journal Article; Review

39471905,Gut microbiota transfer from the preclinical maternal immune activation model of autism is sufficient to induce sex-specific alterations in immune response and behavioural outcomes.,"The gut microbiome plays a vital role in health and disease, including neurodevelopmental disorders like autism spectrum disorder (ASD). ASD affects 4:1 males-to-females, and sex differences are apparent in gut microbiota composition among ASD individuals and in animal models of this condition, such as the maternal immune activation (MIA) mouse model. However, few studies have included sex as a biological variable when assessing the role of gut microbiota in mediating ASD symptoms. Using the MIA model of ASD, we assessed whether gut microbiota contributes to the sex differences in the presentation of ASD-like behaviors. Gut microbiota transplantation from MIA or vehicle/control male and female mice into healthy, otherwise unmanipulated, 4-week-old C57Bl/6 mice was performed for 6 treatments over 12 days. Colonization with male, but not female, MIA microbiota was sufficient to reduce sociability, decrease microbiota diversity and increase neuroinflammation with more pronounced deficits in male recipients. Colonization with both male and female donor microbiota altered juvenile ultrasonic vocalizations and anxiety-like behavior in recipients of both sexes, and there was an accompanied change in the gut microbiota and serum cytokine IL-4 and IL-7 levels of all recipients of MIA gut microbiota. In addition to the increases in gut microbes associated with pathological states, the female donor microbiota profile also had increases in gut microbes with known neural protective effects (e.g., Lactobacillus and Rikenella). These results suggest that gut reactivity to environmental insults, such as in the MIA model, may play a role in shaping the sex disparity in ASD development.","Stephanie Salia, Francine F Burke, Meagan E Hinks, Alison M Randell, Mairead Anna Matheson, Susan G Walling, Ashlyn Swift-Gallant","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2024,Autism; Gut microbiota; Maternal immune activation; Sex differences,10.1016/j.bbi.2024.10.030,"Department of Psychology, Memorial University of Newfoundland, 232 Elizabeth Avenue, St. John's, NL A1B 3X9, Canada.

39460292,Generation and Genetic Stability of a PolX and 5' MGF-Deficient African Swine Fever Virus Mutant for Vaccine Development.,"The African swine fever virus (ASFV) causes fatal disease in pigs and is currently spreading globally. Commercially safe vaccines are urgently required. Aiming to generate a novel live attenuated vaccine (LAV), a recombinant ASFV was generated by deleting the viral O174L (PolX) gene. However, during in vitro generation, an additional spontaneous deletion of genes belonging to the multigene families (MGF) occurred, creating a mixture of two viruses, namely, Arm-ΔPolX and Arm-ΔPolX-ΔMGF. This mixture was used to inoculate pigs in a low and high dose to assess the viral dynamics of both populations in vivo. Although the Arm-ΔPolX population was a much lower proportion of the inoculum, in the high-dose immunized animals, it was the only resulting viral population, while Arm-ΔPolX-ΔMGF only appeared in low-dose immunized animals, revealing the role of deleted MGFs in ASFV fitness in vivo. Furthermore, animals in the low-dose group survived inoculation, whereas animals in the high-dose group died, suggesting that the lack of MGF and PolX genes, and not the PolX gene alone, led to attenuation. The two recombinant viruses were individually isolated and inoculated into piglets, confirming this hypothesis. However, immunization with the Arm-ΔPolX-ΔMGF virus did not induce protection against challenge with the virulent parental ASFV strain. This study demonstrates that deletion of the PolX gene alone neither leads to attenuation nor induces an increased mutation rate in vivo.","Daniel Pérez-Núñez, Daniel W Madden, Gonzalo Vigara-Astillero, David A Meekins, Chester D McDowell, Bianca Libanori-Artiaga, Raquel García-Belmonte, Dashzeveg Bold, Jessie D Trujillo, Konner Cool, Taeyong Kwon, Velmurugan Balaraman, Igor Morozov, Natasha N Gaudreault, Yolanda Revilla, Juergen A Richt",Vaccines,2024,ASFV; Arm/07/CBM/c2; COS-1; LAV; MGF genes; NGS; PolX gene; vaccine; viral populations,10.3390/vaccines12101125,"Microbes in Health and Welfare Department, Centro de Biología Molecular Severo Ochoa (CBM), CSIC-UAM, c/ Nicolás Cabrera 1, 28049 Madrid, Spain.; Center of Excellence for Emerging and Zoonotic Animal Diseases, Department of Diagnostic Medicine/Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Kansas State University, 1800 Denison Ave, Manhattan, KS 66506, USA.; Microbes in Health and Welfare Department, Centro de Biología Molecular Severo Ochoa (CBM), CSIC-UAM, c/ Nicolás Cabrera 1, 28049 Madrid, Spain.; Center of Excellence for Emerging and Zoonotic Animal Diseases, Department of Diagnostic Medicine/Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Kansas State University, 1800 Denison Ave, Manhattan, KS 66506, USA.; Center of Excellence for Emerging and Zoonotic Animal Diseases, Department of Diagnostic Medicine/Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Kansas State University, 1800 Denison Ave, Manhattan, KS 66506, USA.; Center of Excellence for Emerging and Zoonotic Animal Diseases, Department of Diagnostic Medicine/Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Kansas State University, 1800 Denison Ave, Manhattan, KS 66506, USA.; Microbes in Health and Welfare Department, Centro de Biología Molecular Severo Ochoa (CBM), CSIC-UAM, c/ Nicolás Cabrera 1, 28049 Madrid, Spain.; Center of Excellence for Emerging and Zoonotic Animal Diseases, Department of Diagnostic Medicine/Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Kansas State University, 1800 Denison Ave, Manhattan, KS 66506, USA.; Center of Excellence for Emerging and Zoonotic Animal Diseases, Department of Diagnostic Medicine/Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Kansas State University, 1800 Denison Ave, Manhattan, KS 66506, USA.; Center of Excellence for Emerging and Zoonotic Animal Diseases, Department of Diagnostic Medicine/Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Kansas State University, 1800 Denison Ave, Manhattan, KS 66506, USA.; Center of Excellence for Emerging and Zoonotic Animal Diseases, Department of Diagnostic Medicine/Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Kansas State University, 1800 Denison Ave, Manhattan, KS 66506, USA.; Center of Excellence for Emerging and Zoonotic Animal Diseases, Department of Diagnostic Medicine/Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Kansas State University, 1800 Denison Ave, Manhattan, KS 66506, USA.; Center of Excellence for Emerging and Zoonotic Animal Diseases, Department of Diagnostic Medicine/Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Kansas State University, 1800 Denison Ave, Manhattan, KS 66506, USA.; Center of Excellence for Emerging and Zoonotic Animal Diseases, Department of Diagnostic Medicine/Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Kansas State University, 1800 Denison Ave, Manhattan, KS 66506, USA.; Microbes in Health and Welfare Department, Centro de Biología Molecular Severo Ochoa (CBM), CSIC-UAM, c/ Nicolás Cabrera 1, 28049 Madrid, Spain.; Center of Excellence for Emerging and Zoonotic Animal Diseases, Department of Diagnostic Medicine/Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Kansas State University, 1800 Denison Ave, Manhattan, KS 66506, USA.",N/A,BOA-HSHQDC-16-A-B0006 (NBAF); P20 GM130448 (NIGMS NIH HHS); PID2020-117300RB-I00 (Agencia Estatal Investigación (Spain)),Journal Article
39459912,Mpox in East Africa: Learning from COVID-19 and Ebola to Strengthen Public Health Responses.,"The Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention declared mpox a Public Health Emergency of Continental Security (PHECS) in Africa. African public health systems have moved to mobilize a response against a backdrop of inherent significant challenges. With this commentary, we discuss how lessons from past public health emergencies, particularly COVID-19 and Ebola outbreaks, have prepared the region for improved disease surveillance, rapid response strategies, and effective public health communication and how these lessons can be applied to the mpox response, emphasizing the importance of strong healthcare infrastructure, effective data sharing, community engagement, targeted interventions, and robust contact tracing. Additionally, addressing misinformation and building public trust are crucial for controlling the spread of any disease. By leveraging these strategies, African countries can enhance their response to mpox. This includes improving diagnostic capabilities, strengthening cross-border collaborations, and prioritizing vaccination campaigns where needed. Ultimately, by applying the hard-earned lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic and Ebola outbreak, the East Africa region can better address the challenges posed by mpox and safeguard public health.","Pierre Gashema, Tumusime Musafiri, Felix Ndahimana, Hyppolyte Iradukunda, Eric Saramba, Stuart T Nyakatswau, Noel Gahamanyi, Patrick Gad Iradukunda, Ayman Ahmed, Tafadzwa Dzinamarira, Claude Mambo Muvunyi",Viruses,2024,COVID-19; Ebola virus; epidemic; global health security; mpox vaccine; mpox virus; pandemic; poxvirus,10.3390/v16101578,"Department of Research, Repolicy Research Centre, Kigali P.O.

39456184,Design of a Robust Flow Cytometric Approach for Phenotypical and Functional Analysis of Human Monocyte Subsets in Health and Disease.,"Human monocytes can be subdivided into phenotypically and functionally different classical, intermediate and non-classical monocytes according to the cell surface expression of CD14 and CD16. A precise identification and characterisation of monocyte subsets is necessary to unravel their role in inflammatory diseases. Here, we compared three different flow cytometric strategies (A-C) and found that strategy C, which included staining against CD11b, HLA-DR, CD14 and CD16, followed by several gating steps, most reliably identified monocyte subtypes in blood samples from healthy volunteers and from patients with stable coronary heart disease (CHD) or ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Additionally, we established a fixation and permeabilisation protocol to enable the analysis of intracellular markers. We investigated the phagocytosis of lipid nanoparticles, the uptake of 2-NBD-glucose and the intracellular levels of CD74 and HLA-DM. This revealed that classical and intermediate monocytes from patients with STEMI showed the highest uptake of 2-NBD-glucose, whereas classical and intermediate monocytes from patients with CHD took up the largest amounts of lipid nanoparticles. Interestingly, intermediate monocytes had the highest expression level of HLA-DM. Taken together, we present a robust flow cytometric approach for the identification and functional characterisation of monocyte subtypes in healthy humans and patients with diseases.","Talia Ahrazoglu, Jennifer Isabel Kluczny, Patricia Kleimann, Lisa-Marie Irschfeld, Fabian Theodor Nienhaus, Florian Bönner, Norbert Gerdes, Sebastian Temme",Biomolecules,2024,MHC class II pathway; coronary heart disease; flow cytometry; gating; glucose uptake; monocyte subsets; myocardial infarction; phagocytosis,10.3390/biom14101251,"Department of Anesthesiology, Faculty of Medicine, University Hospital, Heinrich-Heine-University, 40225 Düsseldorf, Germany.; Department of Anesthesiology, Faculty of Medicine, University Hospital, Heinrich-Heine-University, 40225 Düsseldorf, Germany.; Institute of Molecular Cardiology, Faculty of Medicine, University Hospital, Heinrich-Heine-University, 40225 Düsseldorf, Germany.; Department of Radiation Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, University Hospital, Heinrich-Heine-University, 40225 Düsseldorf, Germany.; Department of Cardiology, Pulmonology and Vascular Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University Hospital, Heinrich-Heine University, 40225 Düsseldorf, Germany.; Department of Cardiology, Pulmonology and Vascular Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University Hospital, Heinrich-Heine University, 40225 Düsseldorf, Germany.; Department of Cardiology, Pulmonology and Vascular Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University Hospital, Heinrich-Heine University, 40225 Düsseldorf, Germany.; Department of Anesthesiology, Faculty of Medicine, University Hospital, Heinrich-Heine-University, 40225 Düsseldorf, Germany.","Humans; Monocytes; Flow Cytometry; Male; Coronary Disease; Female; HLA-DR Antigens; Middle Aged; Phagocytosis; Receptors, IgG; Lipopolysaccharide Receptors; Histocompatibility Antigens Class II; Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte; CD11b Antigen; ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction; Phenotype; Aged; Adult; Nanoparticles; GPI-Linked Proteins",236177352 (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft); 397484323 (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft); none (Susanne-Bunnenberg-Stiftung at the Düsseldorf Heart Center),Journal Article
39456127,Immune system benefits of pulmonary rehabilitation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a respiratory disease characterized by pulmonary and systemic inflammation. Inflammatory mediators show relationships with shortness of breath, exercise intolerance and health related quality of life. Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR), a comprehensive education and exercise training programme, is the most effective therapy for COPD and is associated with reduced exacerbation and hospitalization rates and increased survival. Exercise training, the primary physiological intervention within PR, is known to exert a beneficial anti-inflammatory effect in health and chronic diseases. The question of this review article is whether exercise training can also make such a beneficial anti-inflammatory effect in COPD. Experimental studies using smoke exposure mice models suggest that the response of the immune system to exercise training is favourably anti-inflammatory. However, the evidence about the response of most known inflammatory mediators (C-reactive protein, tumour necrosis factor α, interleukin 6, interleukin 10) to exercise training in COPD patients is inconsistent, making it difficult to conclude whether regular exercise training has an anti-inflammatory effect in COPD. It is also unclear whether COPD patients with more persistent inflammation are a subgroup that would benefit more from hypothesized immunomodulatory effects of exercise training (i.e., personalized treatment). Nevertheless, it seems that PR combined with maintenance exercise training (i.e., lifestyle change) might be more beneficial in controlling inflammation and slowing disease progress in COPD patients, specifically in those with early stages of disease.","Asghar Abbasi, David Wang, William W Stringer, Richard Casaburi, Harry B Rossiter",Experimental physiology,2024,COPD; exercise training; immune system; inflammation; pulmonary rehabilitation,10.1113/EP091678,"Institute of Respiratory Medicine and Exercise Physiology, The Lundquist Institute for Biomedical Innovation at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, Torrance, California, USA.; Institute of Respiratory Medicine and Exercise Physiology, The Lundquist Institute for Biomedical Innovation at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, Torrance, California, USA.; Institute of Respiratory Medicine and Exercise Physiology, The Lundquist Institute for Biomedical Innovation at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, Torrance, California, USA.; Institute of Respiratory Medicine and Exercise Physiology, The Lundquist Institute for Biomedical Innovation at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, Torrance, California, USA.; Institute of Respiratory Medicine and Exercise Physiology, The Lundquist Institute for Biomedical Innovation at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, Torrance, California, USA.",N/A,28FT-0017 (Tobacco-Related Diseases Research Program (TRDRP)); R01HL151452 (NIH ); R01HL166850 (NIH ); R01HL153460 (NIH ); P50HD098593 (NIH ); R01DK122767 (NIH ); HT9425-24-1-0249 (Department of Defense/USAMRAA),Journal Article; Review
39455500,Involvement of Complement in Alzheimer's Disease: From Genetics Through Pathology to Therapeutic Strategies.,"Complement is a critical component of innate immunity, evolved to defend against pathogens and clear toxic debris ranging from dead and dying cells to immune complexes. These roles make complement a key player in homeostasis; however, complement has a dark side. When the rigid control mechanisms fail, complement becomes dysregulated, acting as a driver of inflammation and resultant pathology in numerous diseases. Roles of complement in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias have emerged in recent years, supported by genetic, biomarker and pathological evidence and animal model studies. Numerous questions remain regarding the precise roles of complement in the brain in health and disease, including where and when complement is expressed, how it contributes to immune defence and garbage disposal in the healthy brain, and exactly how complement contributes to pathology in dementias. In this brief review, we will summarise current knowledge on complement roles in brain, present the evidence implicating complement in AD and explore whether complement represents an attractive therapeutic target for AD.","Nikoleta Daskoulidou, Sarah M Carpanini, Wioleta M Zelek, B Paul Morgan",Current topics in behavioral neurosciences,2024,Biomarkers; Brain; Complement; Dementia; Genetics; Synapse; Therapeutics,10.1007/7854_2024_524,"UK Dementia Research Institute Cardiff, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.; UK Dementia Research Institute Cardiff, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.; UK Dementia Research Institute Cardiff, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.; UK Dementia Research Institute Cardiff, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.

39452426,The Oral Microbiome of Peri-Implant Health and Disease: A Narrative Review.,"Peri-implantitis disease has increased significantly over the last years, resulting in increased failure of implants. Many factors may play a role in implant complications and failure, including ones related to the oral microbiota. This literature review aims to summarize the current knowledge of microbiome of implants in health and disease, focusing not only on the presence/absence of specific microbiota or on their relative abundance, but also on their phenotypic expression and their complex relationships with the host. The authors examined the MEDLINE database and identified key topics about peri-implant oral microbiome in health and disease. The peri-implant microbiome differs from that of the tooth, both in health and disease, as they are structurally and chemically different. The adhesion and formation of the peri-implant biofilm can be affected by the surface energy, topography, wettability, and electrochemical charges of the implant surface. In addition, the morphogenesis of the tissues surrounding the dental implant also differs from the tooth, making the dental implant more susceptible to bacterial infection. This interplay between the microbiome and the host immune system in peri-implant infections still needs to be elucidated.","Natalia de Campos Kajimoto, Yvonne de Paiva Buischi, Mansour Mohamadzadeh, Peter Loomer",Dentistry journal,2024,dental implants; dysbiosis; microbiota; peri-implantitis,10.3390/dj12100299,"Department of Periodontics, The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX 78229, USA.; Department of Periodontics, The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX 78229, USA.; Department of Microbiology, Immunology & Molecular Genetics, The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX 78229, USA.; Department of Periodontics, The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX 78229, USA.",N/A,N/A,Journal Article; Review
39449067,Biologically informed machine learning modeling of immune cells to reveal physiological and pathological aging process.,"The immune system undergoes progressive functional remodeling from neonatal stages to old age. Therefore, understanding how aging shapes immune cell function is vital for precise treatment of patients at different life stages. Here, we constructed the first transcriptomic atlas of immune cells encompassing human lifespan, ranging from newborns to supercentenarians, and comprehensively examined gene expression signatures involving cell signaling, metabolism, differentiation, and functions in all cell types to investigate immune aging changes. By comparing immune cell composition among different age groups, HLA highly expressing NK cells and CD83 positive B cells were identified with high percentages exclusively in the teenager (Tg) group, whereas unknown_T cells were exclusively enriched in the supercentenarian (Sc) group. Notably, we found that the biological age (BA) of pediatric COVID-19 patients with multisystem inflammatory syndrome accelerated aging according to their chronological age (CA). Besides, we proved that inflammatory shift- myeloid abundance and signature correlate with the progression of complications in Kawasaki disease (KD). The shift- myeloid signature was also found to be associated with KD treatment resistance, and effective therapies improve treatment outcomes by reducing this signaling. Finally, based on those age-related immune cell compositions, we developed a novel BA prediction model PHARE ( https://xiazlab.org/phare/ ), which can apply to both scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq data. Using this model, we found patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) also exhibit accelerated aging compared to healthy individuals. Overall, our study revealed changes in immune cell proportions and function associated with aging, both in health and disease, and provided a novel tool for successfully capturing features that accelerate or delay aging.","Cangang Zhang, Tao Ren, Xiaofan Zhao, Yanhong Su, Qianhao Wang, Tianzhe Zhang, Boxiao He, Yabing Chen, Ling-Yun Wu, Lina Sun, Baojun Zhang, Zheng Xia",Immunity & ageing : I & A,2024,Aging clock; Biological age; Chronological age; Immune aging; Machine learning,10.1186/s12979-024-00479-4,"Department of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China.; Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.; Department of Biomedical Engineering, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, USA.; Department of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China.; Department of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China.; Department of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China.; State Key Laboratory of Virology, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, USA.; Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.; Department of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China. lina.sun@xjtu.edu.cn.; Department of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China. bj.zhang@mail.xjtu.edu.cn.; Department of Biomedical Engineering, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, USA. xiaz@ohsu.edu.",N/A,N/A,Journal Article

CyTOF enables high-dimensional cell phenotyping using tens of surface and intra-cellular markers. To utilize the full potential of CyTOF, we need advanced clustering and machine learning methodologies to enable automated gating of the complex data. Here we show that critical modifications to a machine learning based FlowSOM package and precise parameter optimization can enable us to reliably analyze the complex CyTOF data. We show the impact of key parameters on clustering outcomes while addressing bugs within the publicly available package. We modified the FlowSOM pipeline to fix the bugs, enable scalability to handle large datasets and perform parameter optimization. We further validated this modified pipeline on a substantial external immunological dataset demonstrating the need of data-specific tailored parameter optimization to ensure reliable definition and interrogation of immune cell populations associated with immune disorders.","Weiyang Tao, Anirban Sinha, Khadir Raddassi, Aridaman Pandit",Frontiers in immunology,2024,FlowSOM; clustering; cyTOF; high-dimensional dataset; parameter optimization,10.3389/fimmu.2024.1414400,"Immunology Discovery Research, AbbVie Cambridge Research Center, Cambridge, MA, United States.; Immunology Discovery Research, AbbVie Cambridge Research Center, Cambridge, MA, United States.; Immunology Discovery Research, AbbVie Cambridge Research Center, Cambridge, MA, United States.; Immunology Discovery Research, AbbVie Cambridge Research Center, Cambridge, MA, United States.",Humans; Cluster Analysis; Flow Cytometry; Machine Learning; Immunophenotyping; Software,N/A,Journal Article
39444597,Association of the belief in conspiracy narratives with vaccination status and recommendation behaviours of German physicians.,"Vaccine hesitancy has been identified as one of the top ten threats to global health by the World Health Organization (WHO). The belief in conspiracy narratives is repeatedly discussed as a major driver of vaccine hesitancy among the general population. However, there is a lack of research investigating the role of the belief in conspiracy narratives in vaccination decisions and recommendation behaviours of physicians. This is particularly relevant as physicians are one of the major and trusted sources of information for patients' vaccination decisions. This study therefore investigated the association between believing in COVID-19-related conspiracy narratives and physicians' own COVID-19 vaccination status and their recommendation behavior for COVID-19 and other vaccines (e.g., HPV or flu). In a cross-sectional survey among German physicians (N = 602, April 2022) two conspiracy narratives were assessed, stating that the coronavirus is a hoax or that it is human-made. Additional control variables included trust in health institutions, the rejection of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), the 5C psychological antecedents of vaccination (confidence, complacency, constraints, calculation, and collective responsibility) and demographic variables. Hierarchical regressions indicated that greater belief in the conspiracy narrative claiming that the coronavirus is a hoax was associated with lower COVID-19 vaccination uptake and fewer COVID-19 vaccination recommendations among physicians. The results for recommendation behavior remain robust even when controlling for other variables. Contrary to our assumption, believing that the coronavirus is human-made was not related to vaccination status nor vaccine recommendation behavior. In conclusion, believing in conspiracy narratives that question the existence and thus also the danger of the virus is an important independent predictor of vaccine hesitancy among physicians that should be addressed in future public health interventions.","Frederike Taubert, Philipp Schmid, Dawn Holford, Pierre Verger, Angelo Fasce, Linda C Karlsson, Anna Soveri, Stephan Lewandowsky, Cornelia Betsch",Vaccine: X,2024,COVID-19; Conspiracy theories; Physicians; Recommendations; Trust; Vaccine hesitancy,10.1016/j.jvacx.2024.100560,"Institute for Planetary Health Behavior, Health Communication, University of Erfurt, Nordhäuser Straße 63, 99089 Erfurt, Germany.; Institute for Planetary Health Behavior, Health Communication, University of Erfurt, Nordhäuser Straße 63, 99089 Erfurt, Germany.; School of Psychological Science, University of Bristol, 12A Priory Road, Bristol BS8 1TU, United Kingdom.; Southeastern France Health Regional Observatory (ORS PACA), Faculty of Medicine, 2 Place Le Verrier, 13004 Marseille, France.; Southeastern Health Regional Observatory (ORS PACA), 13004 Marseille, France.; Department of Psychology and Speech-Language Pathology, University of Turku, 20014 Turku, Finland.; Department of Psychology, Åbo Akademi University, Tehtaankatu 2, 20500 Turku, Finland.; School of Psychological Science, University of Bristol, 12A Priory Road, Bristol BS8 1TU, United Kingdom.; Institute for Planetary Health Behavior, Health Communication, University of Erfurt, Nordhäuser Straße 63, 99089 Erfurt, Germany.",N/A,N/A,Journal Article
39442170,Transitioning Perspectives in Digital Health Through Phenomenology Integration.,"The evolution of digital health, from its early days as eHealth to its current expansive scope, reflects a significant transformation in health care delivery and management. This transition underscores the integration of digital technologies across the health continuum from prevention and diagnosis to treatment and rehabilitation. The emergence of digital health has introduced innovative solutions but also posed challenges, particularly in aligning technological advancements with health needs, human experiences, and ethical considerations. This position paper aims to explore the integration of phenomenology in digital health, advocating for a paradigm that emphasizes the centrality of human experience in the design and implementation of digital health solutions. It specifically seeks to address challenges related to relevance for individuals who ""speak"" different languages, ensuring long-term use, addressing digital and health literacy, coordinating various sources, and navigating ethical issues in the rapidly evolving digital health landscape. Drawing upon years of research and practical experience in communication technologies and health, this paper uses a reflective approach to examine the intersection of digital health and phenomenology. It reviews the historical development of digital health, identifies the challenges faced during its evolution, and discusses the potential of phenomenological methods to enhance user-centered design and ethical practices in digital health. The integration of phenomenology into digital health facilitates a deeper understanding of user experiences, enabling the development of more responsive and ethical digital health solutions. Participatory design models, informed by phenomenological perspectives, offer a pathway to bridge the gap between technological innovation and human-centric health care. The paper highlights successful practices in digital health development, including mobile apps for vaccination decision-making and platforms for managing chronic conditions, illustrating the benefits of a phenomenological approach.

The most abundant cell type was of dendritic morphology. Lymphocyte foci were not evident in the palatoglossal folds or the gingiva. Immunohistochemical staining (IHC) for validated leukocyte markers followed, including CD3, CD20, CD79α, CD204, and Iba1. Consistent with H&E findings, CD204 immunoreactivity predominated amongst all niches. With the exception of the alveolar mucosa and palatoglossal folds, we also demonstrate a significant difference in the population of macrophages by region for only the Iba1 antigen (p < 0.0001). B lymphocytes were found, and a significant difference was noted in the sub-epithelium where CD20-positive cells outnumbered those labelled as CD79a positive (p = 0.001), suggesting the possibility that these cells are in an active state in health. A similar significant difference was found in the subepithelial tissue for myeloid cells, as there were more cells labelled as CD204 positive over Iba1, which, along with their distribution pattern, indicates a possible functional and morphological overlap between these cells. No significant difference was found in epithelial tissues for cells of either myeloid or lymphoid origins. The results from this study suggest different regions of the oral cavity exhibit variations in the distribution of immune cells, particularly macrophages and B lymphocytes. Though more studies would be needed to confirm these findings, these differences may have implications for the immune response and overall health of the oral mucosa.","Maria Soltero-Rivera, Myles Bailey, Andrew Blandino, Boaz Arzi, Natalia Vapniarsky","Anatomia, histologia, embryologia",2024,canine; oral immunology; oral mucosa; veterinary dentistry,10.1111/ahe.13113,"Department of Surgical and Radiological Sciences, University of California, Davis, Davis, California, USA.; Department of Surgical and Radiological Sciences, University of California, Davis, Davis, California, USA.; Department of Statistics, University of California, Davis, Davis, California, USA.; Department of Surgical and Radiological Sciences, University of California, Davis, Davis, California, USA.; Department of Pathology, Microbiology & Immunology, University of California, Davis, Davis, California, USA.",Animals; Mouth Mucosa; Macrophages; Dogs; Male; Female; B-Lymphocytes; Immunohistochemistry; Dendritic Cells; Myeloid Cells,"2022-14-F (Center for Companion Animal Health, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of California, Davis-Donaldand Miriam Stelling Research Award)",Journal Article

Finally, we highlight how computational modeling techniques, especially agent-based modeling, complement experimental data by elucidating neutrophil kinetics at the level of individual cells as well as their collective behavior. Understanding the role of neutrophils in health and disease is essential for developing new strategies for combating infection, inflammation and cancer.","Andrew O Yam, Arnolda Jakovija, Catherine Gatt, Tatyana Chtanova",Frontiers in immunology,2024,cancer; imaging; infection; intravital 2-photon microscopy; migration; neutrophil; wound healing,10.3389/fimmu.2024.1458035,"School of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia.; St Vincent's School of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia.; St Vincent's School of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia.; School of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",Neutrophils; Intravital Microscopy; Humans; Neoplasms; Inflammation; Animals; Tumor Microenvironment; Infections,N/A,Journal Article; Review

39437372,Promoting Equitable and Affordable Patient Access to Safe and Effective Innovations in Donation and Transplantation of Substances of Human Origin and Derived Therapies.,"Innovation is a hallmark of organ, tissue, and cell transplantation. The development of new treatments derived from these substances of human origin (SoHO) has rapidly evolved in recent years. Despite the great benefits that these innovative therapies could bring to patients, significant difficulties have arisen in making them equitably and widely accessible. Herein, we identify and address 4 challenges to promote innovation in this field in a collaborative, sustainable, and transparent manner and propose some concrete solutions applicable to SoHO-derived treatments, ranging from cell therapies to solid organ transplantation. Regulators, health policymakers, and government officials are recommended to incorporate specific elements into the regulatory frameworks of their respective jurisdictions, although regulatory convergence and equivalent quality and safety standards applicable to SoHO at a global level would be needed. An innovation-driven regulatory environment, respectful with the human origin and in accordance with the altruistic donation of SoHO, should be encouraged to improve the safety, effectiveness, accessibility, and affordability of SoHO and to promote collaboration between countries and between public and private sectors. This overview is the outcome of a working group focused on ""Innovation in the donation and clinical application of SoHO"" as part of the international Summit ""Towards Global Convergence in Transplantation: Sufficiency, Transparency and Oversight"" convened by the Organización Nacional de Trasplantes under the Spanish Presidency of the Council of the European Union in November 2023 and cosponsored by the Council of Europe, the World Health Organization, the Transplantation Society, and the European Society for Organ Transplantation.","Natividad Cuende, Stefan G Tullius, Ander Izeta, Verena Plattner, Martin Börgel, Rachele Ciccocioppo, Rafael Correa-Rocha, Mickey B C Koh, Vincenzo De Angelis, Gabriel E Gondolesi, Renske Ten Ham, Robert J Porte, Dolores Hernández-Maraver, Wayne J Hawthorne, Anna Sureda, Giuseppe Orlando, Börje Haraldsson, Nancy L Ascher, Beatriz Dominguez-Gil, Gabriel C Oniscu",Transplantation,2024,N/A,10.1097/TP.0000000000005169,"Andalusian Transplant Coordination, Servicio Andaluz de Salud, Sevilla, Spain.; Division of Transplant Surgery and Transplant Surgery Research Laboratory, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.; Donostia University Hospital and Biogipuzkoa Health Research Institute, Advanced Therapies Unit, Donostia-San Sebastian, Spain.; Department Blood, Tissue and Vigilance, Federal Office for Safety in Health Care, Vienna, Austria.; Deutsche Gesellschaft für Gewebetransplantation mbH, Gemeinnützige Gesellschaft, Hannover, Germany.; Gastroenterology Unit, Department of Medicine, A.O.U.I.

Certain bacterial species within the intestinal tract can chronically activate the immune system, leading to low-grade intestinal inflammation. As a result, plasma cells produce high levels of secretory antigen-specific immunoglobulin A (IgA), which coats the immunostimulatory bacteria. This IgA immune response against intestinal bacteria may be associated with the maintenance of homeostasis and health, as well as disease. Unraveling this dichotomy and identifying the immunostimulatory bacteria is crucial for understanding the relationship between the intestinal microbiota and the immune system, and their role in health and disease.

39432666,Biologically-informed killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor gene annotation tool.,"Natural killer (NK) cells are essential components of the innate immune system, with their activity significantly regulated by Killer cell Immunoglobulin-like Receptors (KIRs). The diversity and structural complexity of KIR genes present significant challenges for accurate genotyping, essential for understanding NK cell functions and their implications in health and disease. Traditional genotyping methods struggle with the variable nature of KIR genes, leading to inaccuracies that can impede immunogenetic research. These challenges extend to high-quality phased assemblies, which have been recently popularized by the Human Pangenome Consortium. This article introduces BAKIR (Biologically informed Annotator for KIR locus), a tailored computational tool designed to overcome the challenges of KIR genotyping and annotation on high-quality, phased genome assemblies. BAKIR aims to enhance the accuracy of KIR gene annotations by structuring its annotation pipeline around identifying key functional mutations, thereby improving the identification and subsequent relevance of gene and allele calls. It uses a multi-stage mapping, alignment, and variant calling process to ensure high-precision gene and allele identification, while also maintaining high recall for sequences that are significantly mutated or truncated relative to the known allele database. BAKIR has been evaluated on a subset of the HPRC assemblies, where BAKIR was able to improve many of the associated annotations and call novel variants. BAKIR is freely available on GitHub, offering ease of access and use through multiple installation methods, including pip, conda, and singularity container, and is equipped with a user-friendly command-line interface, thereby promoting its adoption in the scientific community.","Michael K B Ford, Ananth Hari, Qinghui Zhou, Ibrahim Numanagić, S Cenk Sahinalp","Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",2024,N/A,10.1093/bioinformatics/btae622,"National Cancer Institute, NIH, 9000 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, MD, 20892, United States.; National Cancer Institute, NIH, 9000 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, MD, 20892, United States.; Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science, University of Victoria, 3800 Finnerty Rd, Victoria, BC, V8P 5C2, Canada.; Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science, University of Victoria, 3800 Finnerty Rd, Victoria, BC, V8P 5C2, Canada.; National Cancer Institute, NIH, 9000 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, MD, 20892, United States.","Receptors, KIR; Humans; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Software; Killer Cells, Natural; Alleles; Computational Biology",N/A,Journal Article

The FLUence Project.","Infections, particularly those involving the respiratory tract, are associated with an increased incidence of cardiovascular events, both de novo and as exacerbations of pre-existing cardiovascular diseases. Influenza vaccination has consistently been shown to reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events. Nonetheless, vaccination rates among adults remain suboptimal, both in the general population and among high-risk individuals. Multiple barriers hinder achieving adequate vaccination rates, with physicians' beliefs and attitudes towards these interventions being crucial. The FLUence project was developed within the framework of the World Heart Federation's Emerging Leaders program, to address this issue. This project has two phases: a global quantitative survey to assess the perceptions, opinions, and attitudes and challenges of physicians worldwide regarding the safety and efficacy of the influenza vaccination use, and a qualitative survey to further investigate the barriers and facilitators of recommending and using this vaccination. The quantitative survey was created and disseminated in five languages (English, Spanish, French, Italian, and Portuguese) to physicians of all specialties who care for adults, with a particular focus on patients with cardiovascular disease. The survey included eight domains with a total of 36 questions with closed options; a Likert scale with five possible answers was used to gauge participants' opinions. To gain deeper insights into the complexities behind the low vaccination rates in adults, the second part of the project comprises a qualitative survey, conducted in the two lower-middle- and upper-middle-income countries: India and Argentina, respectively. These countries were selected because patients with cardiovascular diseases have access to free influenza vaccination in Argentina, whereas patients must pay for the vaccine out of pocket in India. Thus, the FLUence study will provide valuable information to better understand the perceptions and barriers to improving influenza vaccination rates from the perspective of physicians. It is imperative to actively engage all healthcare providers to improve influenza vaccination rates.","Sebastián Garcia-Zamora, Angela S Koh, Svetlana Stoica, Nariman Sepehrvand, Harish Ranjani, Salisu Ishaku, Naomi Herz, Vanessa Kandoole-Kabwere, Pablo Perel, Amitava Banerjee, Charlotte Warren-Gash, Sean Taylor, Daniel José Piñeiro, María Inés Sosa-Liprandi, Álvaro Sosa-Liprandi",Global heart,2024,cardiovascular disease; inflammation; influenza; survey; vaccine,10.5334/gh.1358,"Department of Research Methodology and Evidence-Based Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, National University of Rosario (UNR), Argentina.; Emerging Leaders Programme, Cohort 2022, World Heart Federation, Switzerland.; Emerging Leaders Programme, Cohort 2022, World Heart Federation, Switzerland.; Emerging Leaders Programme, Cohort 2022, World Heart Federation, Switzerland.; Emerging Leaders Programme, Cohort 2022, World Heart Federation, Switzerland.; Emerging Leaders Programme, Cohort 2022, World Heart Federation, Switzerland.; Emerging Leaders Programme, Cohort 2022, World Heart Federation, Switzerland.; Emerging Leaders Programme, Cohort 2022, World Heart Federation, Switzerland.; Department of Non-Communicable Disease Epidemiology, Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom.; World Heart Federation, Geneva, Switzerland.; Department of Non-Communicable Disease Epidemiology, Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom.; World Heart Federation, Geneva, Switzerland.; Department of Medicine, University of Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina.; Cardiology Department, Sanatorio Güemes, Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires, Argentina.; Cardiology Department, Sanatorio Güemes, Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires, Argentina.","Humans; Cardiovascular Diseases; Influenza Vaccines; Influenza, Human; Attitude of Health Personnel; Vaccination; Physicians; Surveys and Questionnaires; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Male; Practice Patterns, Physicians'; Female",N/A,Journal Article; Multicenter Study

39420677,An update on autophagy disorders.,"Macroautophagy is a highly conserved cellular pathway for the degradation and recycling of defective cargo including proteins, organelles, and macromolecular complexes. As autophagy is particularly relevant for cellular homeostasis in post-mitotic tissues, congenital disorders of autophagy, due to monogenic defects in key autophagy genes, share a common ""clinical signature"" including neurodevelopmental, neurodegenerative, and neuromuscular features, as well as variable abnormalities of the eyes, skin, heart, bones, immune cells, and other organ systems, depending on the expression pattern and the specific function of the defective proteins. Since the clinical and genetic resolution of EPG5-related Vici syndrome, the paradigmatic congenital disorder of autophagy, the widespread use of massively parallel sequencing has resulted in the identification of a growing number of autophagy-associated disease genes, encoding members of the core autophagy machinery as well as related proteins. Recently identified monogenic disorders linking selective autophagy, vesicular trafficking, and other pathways have further expanded the molecular and phenotypical spectrum of congenital disorders of autophagy as a clinical disease spectrum. Moreover, significant advances in basic research have enhanced the understanding of the underlying pathophysiology as a basis for therapy development. Here, we review (i) autophagy in the context of other intracellular trafficking pathways; (ii) the main congenital disorders of autophagy and their typical clinico-pathological signatures; and (iii) the recommended primary health surveillance in monogenic disorders of autophagy based on available evidence. We further discuss recently identified molecular mechanisms that inform the current understanding of autophagy in health and disease, as well as perspectives on future therapeutic approaches.","Hormos Salimi Dafsari, Diego Martinelli, Afshin Saffari, Darius Ebrahimi-Fakhari, Manolis Fanto, Carlo Dionisi-Vici, Heinz Jungbluth",Journal of inherited metabolic disease,2024,autophagy; cellular trafficking; congenital disorders; neurodegeneration; neurodevelopment,10.1002/jimd.12798,"Department of Pediatrics and Center for Rare Diseases, Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital Cologne, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.; Division of Metabolic Diseases, Bambino Gesù Children's Hospital IRCCS, Rome, Italy.; Division of Child Neurology and Inherited Metabolic Diseases, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.; Department of Neurology and F.M.

39418818,"Influence of polymorphisms on the phenotype of TLR1, TLR4 and TLR9 genes and their association with cervical cancer: Bioinformatics prediction analysis and a case-control study.","Susceptibility to cervical cancer has been associated with Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which is an important component of innate immunity. According to previous studies, polymorphisms in TLRs genes can affect immune response pathways and lead to the development of cervical cancer. The present study aims to evaluate the functionality of polymorphisms in TLR1, TLR4 and TLR9 genes and their associations with cervical cancer. To identify the functionality of polymorphisms, we used the following tools: MUpro, ChimeraX, SNP2TFBS and GTEx. A case-control study including 57 cases (11 High-grade Intraepithelial Lesion - HSIL and 46 cervical cancer) and 67 clinically healthy controls was conducted in the Brazilian population. Polymorphisms genotyping was performed by real-time PCR, using TaqMan probes, using the allelic discrimination method. Bioinformatics prediction showed that the TLR1 rs4833095 [NM_003263.4 (TLR1):c.743T>C (p.Asn248Ser)] and TLR4 rs4986790 [NM_138554.5 (TLR4):c.896A>G (p.Asp299Gly)] polymorphisms alter the structure and stability of their respective proteins. TLR9 rs187084 [NM_017442.3(TLR9):c.-1486A>G] polymorphism seems to affect the THAP1 binding site and modify gene expression. In the case-control study, the c.743TC heterozygous genotype of the rs4833095 SNP in the TLR1 gene was associated with an increased risk for HSIL/cervical cancer. No association of TLR4 rs4986790 and TLR9 rs187084 SNPs with HSIL/cervical cancer was found in the studied population. Allelic combination CAG (rs4833095/ rs4986790/ rs187084) increased the risk of cervical cancer. In conclusion, the present study identified that polymorphisms in TLRs genes can affect the phenotype of their respective genes and contribute to the development of HSIL or cervical cancer.","Edilson Leite de Moura, Israel Faustino Dos Santos, Paulo Pedro de Freitas, Denise Macedo da Silva, Ana Caroline Melo Dos Santos, Aline Cristine Pereira E Silva, Abel Barbosa Lira Neto, Rubens Pessoa de Barros, Jhonatan David Santos das Neves, Nirliane Ribeiro Barbosa, Carolinne de Sales Marques, Carlos Alberto de Carvalho Fraga, Karol Fireman de Farias, Elaine Virginia Martins de Souza Figueiredo",Cancer genetics,2024,Bioinformatics; Cervical cancer; Human papillomavirus; Polymorphisms; Toll-like receptors,10.1016/j.cancergen.2024.10.001,"Laboratory of Molecular Biology and Gene Expression (LABMEG), Federal University of Alagoas (UFAL), Arapiraca, Brazil; Post-Graduation Program in Health Science, Institute of Biological Sciences and Health (ICBS), Federal University of Alagoas (UFAL), Maceió, Brazil.

39418255,Assessments of effectiveness of technologies utilizations in VIHSCM among selected health facilities in Tanzania mainland.,"Immunization coverage remains a challenge in many developing countries Tanzania being no exception. The current increase in technology adoption in the immunisation supply chain promises the attainment of universal health coverage and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) on immunisation. This study evaluates the effectiveness of technology integration in Vaccine and Immunization Health Supply Chain Management (VIHSCM) in Tanzania. This study adopted an exploratory descriptive cross-sectional design. The study collected data using structured questionnaires from health facilities that adopted VIHSCM technologies in Arusha, Mwanza, Morogoro and Mbeya regions, Tanzania. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and cross-tabulations with the aid of the Statistical Package of Social Sciences 23rd Edition (SPSS). The study included 37 health facilities in Tanzania, mainly district hospitals (59.5%). Respondents were mostly female (70.3%), averaging 45 years old, with 1-5 years of immunization experience. While all facilities had refrigerators, digital reporting tool usage was low, with many relying on paper forms. District hospitals and health centres had higher digital tool adoption rates compared to dispensaries. Despite the underutilization of systems like ILS, TImR, and GoTHOMIS, digital tools were deemed crucial for vaccine supply management. While District Hospitals report high relevance of digital tools, Health Centres and Dispensaries show moderate relevance. Challenges include incomplete technology adoption, inadequate infrastructure, and variable perceptions of technology effectiveness. Digital technologies significantly improve vaccine and immunization supply chain management, particularly in larger facilities. Technologies like the Tanzania Immunization Registry (TImR) and Integrated Logistics Systems (ILS) enhance data accuracy and efficiency. Addressing facility-specific challenges and increasing investment in digital tools are crucial for optimizing vaccine supply chains and achieving immunization targets in Tanzania. Future research should involve larger samples to generalize findings and further explore technology impacts on VIHSCM.","Henry A Mollel, Lawrencia D Mushi, Richard V Nkwera",PLOS global public health,2024,N/A,10.1371/journal.pgph.0002635,"Department of Health Information Systems, Mzumbe University, Morogoro, Tanzania.; Department of Health Information Systems, Mzumbe University, Morogoro, Tanzania.; Centre of Excellence in Health Monitoring and Evaluation, Mzumbe University, Morogoro, Tanzania.",N/A,N/A,Journal Article
39417994,The lifespan and kinetics of human dendritic cell subsets and their precursors in health and inflammation.,"Dendritic cells (DC) are specialized mononuclear phagocytes that link innate and adaptive immunity. They comprise two principal subsets: plasmacytoid DC (pDC) and conventional DC (cDC). Understanding the generation, differentiation, and migration of cDC is critical for immune homeostasis. Through human in vivo deuterium-glucose labeling, we observed the rapid appearance of AXL+ Siglec6+ DC (ASDC) in the bloodstream. ASDC circulate for ∼2.16 days, while cDC1 and DC2 circulate for ∼1.32 and ∼2.20 days, respectively, upon release from the bone marrow. Interestingly, DC3, a cDC subset that shares several similarities with monocytes, exhibits a labeling profile closely resembling that of DC2. In a human in vivo model of cutaneous inflammation, ASDC were recruited to the inflammatory site, displaying a distinctive effector signature. Taken together, these results quantify the ephemeral circulating lifespan of human cDC and propose functions of cDC and their precursors that are rapidly recruited to sites of inflammation.","Ruth Lubin, Amit A Patel, Jonas Mackerodt, Yan Zhang, Rotem Gvili, Kevin Mulder, Charles-Antoine Dutertre, Parinaaz Jalali, James R W Glanville, Idit Hazan, Nikhila Sridharan, Gurion Rivkin, Ayse Akarca, Teresa Marafioti, Derek W Gilroy, Leonid Kandel, Alexander Mildner, Asaf Wilensky, Becca Asquith, Florent Ginhoux, Derek Macallan, Simon Yona",The Journal of experimental medicine,2024,N/A,10.1084/jem.20220867,"The Institute of Biomedical and Oral Research, Faculty of Dental Medicine, Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel.; Division of Medicine, University College London, London, UK.; Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, London, UK.; Institute for Infection and Immunity, St. George's, University of London , London, UK.; The Institute of Biomedical and Oral Research, Faculty of Dental Medicine, Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel.; Gustave Roussy Cancer Campus , Villejuif, France.; Gustave Roussy Cancer Campus , Villejuif, France.; Division of Medicine, University College London, London, UK.; Division of Medicine, University College London, London, UK.; The Institute of Biomedical and Oral Research, Faculty of Dental Medicine, Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel.; The Institute of Biomedical and Oral Research, Faculty of Dental Medicine, Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel.; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center , Jerusalem, Israel.; University College London , London, UK.; University College London , London, UK.; Division of Medicine, University College London, London, UK.; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center , Jerusalem, Israel.; MediCity Research Laboratory, University of Turku, Turku, Finland.; Department of Periodontology, Faculty of Dental Medicine, Hadassah Medical Center, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel.; Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College London, London, UK.; Gustave Roussy Cancer Campus , Villejuif, France.; Institute for Infection and Immunity, St. George's, University of London , London, UK.; The Institute of Biomedical and Oral Research, Faculty of Dental Medicine, Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel.",Humans; Dendritic Cells; Inflammation; Kinetics; Cell Differentiation; Male; Axl Receptor Tyrosine Kinase; Female; Adult,G1001052 (Medical Research Council); 093053/Z/10/Z (Wellcome Trust); 192/20 (Israel Science Foundation); 15012 (Bloodwise),Journal Article

This review explored the physiology underlying this pathway, focusing on the mechanisms by which the sympathetic nervous system influences immune function. We delved into the roles of specific adrenergic receptors, primarily the beta-adrenergic receptors, in mediating anti-inflammatory effects, highlighting the involved molecular signaling pathways. Additionally, we examined the immunological implications of adrenergic modulation, discussing how these pathways contributed to the resolution of inflammation and the potential for dysregulation in various disease states. Emerging evidence on the therapeutic potential of targeting the adrenergic anti-inflammatory pathway in conditions such as sepsis, autoimmune diseases, and chronic inflammatory disorders was also reviewed. By integrating current knowledge on the physiology and immunology of this pathway, this review aimed to provide a comprehensive understanding of its role in health and disease, offering insights into future research directions and clinical applications.","Alaa A Aboulata, Ibrahim M Shatla",The Egyptian journal of immunology,2024,N/A,N/A,"Department of Biomedical and Dental sciences, Faculty of Dentistry, Al-Baha University, Saudi Arabia.; Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Al-Baha University, Saudi Arabia.","Humans; Inflammation; Animals; Signal Transduction; Receptors, Adrenergic; Sympathetic Nervous System; Receptors, Adrenergic, beta; Catecholamines; Anti-Inflammatory Agents",N/A,Journal Article; Review
39414743,Human PapillomaVirus Vaccine Uptake: Attitudes and Practices Among Moroccan Physicians.,"In Morocco, cervical cancer is a serious public health problem with an estimated number of 2165 new cases and 1199 deaths in 2020. The human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine has been available in Morocco since 2008. Few data are available on physicians' practices and attitudes toward HPV vaccine. Hence, this study aims to evaluate physicians' awareness and practice towards HPV vaccine and to highlight the main factors affecting physicians' recommendation of this vaccine in Morocco. We have carried out a structured interviewer-administered questionnaire with 500 physicians in different Moroccan regions between March 2019 and March 2020. This study showed an insufficient level of awareness of the two most common types of HPV associated with cervical cancer (36.6%). The rate of HPV vaccine recommendation did not exceed 16.6%. However, more than 63% of participants who were aware of HPV vaccine were willing to recommend it for their future eligible patients. Age (p value < 0.01), sector of activity (p value < 0.01), awareness of the two most common types of HPV associated with genital warts (p value = 0.02), of the vaccine schedules (p value = 0.03), and of the commercial name of this vaccine (p value < 0.01), were significant factors influencing physicians' recommendation of HPV vaccine. Our results showed that, older age (above 51 years old) was associated with negative attitude towards the recommendation of this vaccine (OR: 0.17, 0.06-0.46 CI 95%). Practice in public sector was positively associated with recommendation of HPV vaccine (OR: 7.54, 3.38-16.80 CI 95%). Who were aware of the two most common types of HPV associated with genital warts were more likely to recommend HPV vaccine (OR: 3.36, 1.31-8.65 CI 95%). In the same line, participants, who were also more likely to recommend the vaccine, were those who were aware of HPV vaccine schedules (OR: 6.07, 3.51-10.50 IC 95%); participants who were aware of the commercial name of the HPV vaccine were more likely to recommend the vaccine (OR: 10.04, 5.02-20.09 IC 95%). Indeed, raising physicians' awareness is urgently needed to improve HPV vaccine coverage within Moroccan population.","Aicha Yacouti, Rachida Baddou, Hiba Bourissi, Sana Ez-Zaouy, Hafssa Amayou, Khadija Elmalki, Abdeljalil El Got, Abdellatif Benider, Samira Zoa Assoumou, Mustapha Mouallif",Journal of cancer education : the official journal of the American Association for Cancer Education,2024,Awareness; Cervical cancer; Factors; HPV vaccine; Physicians’ recommendation,10.1007/s13187-024-02505-x,"Laboratory of Research in Health Sciences and Technologies, Higher Institute of Health Sciences, Hassan First University of Settat, BP 555, Settat, Morocco.; Laboratory of Research in Health Sciences and Technologies, Higher Institute of Health Sciences, Hassan First University of Settat, BP 555, Settat, Morocco.; Laboratory of Research in Health Sciences and Technologies, Higher Institute of Health Sciences, Hassan First University of Settat, BP 555, Settat, Morocco.; Laboratory of Research in Health Sciences and Technologies, Higher Institute of Health Sciences, Hassan First University of Settat, BP 555, Settat, Morocco.; Laboratory of Research in Health Sciences and Technologies, Higher Institute of Health Sciences, Hassan First University of Settat, BP 555, Settat, Morocco.; Laboratory of Research in Health Sciences and Technologies, Higher Institute of Health Sciences, Hassan First University of Settat, BP 555, Settat, Morocco.; Laboratory of Research in Health Sciences and Technologies, Higher Institute of Health Sciences, Hassan First University of Settat, BP 555, Settat, Morocco.; Mohammed VI Center for the Treatment of Cancers, Ibn Rochd University Hospital Center, Casablanca, Morocco.; Department of Bacteriology-Virology, University of Health Sciences, Libreville, Gabon.; Laboratory of Research in Health Sciences and Technologies, Higher Institute of Health Sciences, Hassan First University of Settat, BP 555, Settat, Morocco. m.mouallif@gmail.com.","Humans; Papillomavirus Vaccines; Female; Morocco; Papillomavirus Infections; Adult; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Male; Physicians; Surveys and Questionnaires; Middle Aged; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms; Attitude of Health Personnel; Practice Patterns, Physicians'; Vaccination; Cross-Sectional Studies",18UHP2019 (National Centre for Scientific and Technical Research),Journal Article
39409881,Chondroitin Sulfate Proteoglycan 4 (CSPG4) as an Emerging Target for Immunotherapy to Treat Melanoma.,"Immunotherapies, including checkpoint inhibitor antibodies, have precipitated significant improvements in clinical outcomes for melanoma. However, approximately half of patients do not benefit from approved treatments. Additionally, apart from Tebentafusp, which is approved for the treatment of uveal melanoma, there is a lack of immunotherapies directly focused on melanoma cells. This is partly due to few available targets, especially those expressed on the cancer cell surface. Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 (CSPG4) is a cell surface molecule overexpressed in human melanoma, with restricted distribution and low expression in non-malignant tissues and involved in several cancer-promoting and dissemination pathways. Here, we summarize the current understanding of the expression and functional significance of CSPG4 in health and melanoma, and we outline immunotherapeutic strategies. These include monoclonal antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), chimeric-antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, and other strategies such as anti-idiotypic and mimotope vaccines to raise immune responses against CSPG4-expressing melanomas. Several showed promising functions in preclinical models of melanoma, yet few have reached clinical testing, and none are approved for therapeutic use. Obstacles preventing that progress include limited knowledge of CSPG4 function in human cancer and a lack of in vivo models that adequately represent patient immune responses and human melanoma biology. Despite several challenges, immunotherapy directed to CSPG4-expressing melanoma harbors significant potential to transform the treatment landscape.","Xinyi Chen, Shabana Habib, Madalina Alexandru, Jitesh Chauhan, Theodore Evan, Joanna M Troka, Avigail Rahimi, Benjamina Esapa, Thomas J Tull, Wen Zhe Ng, Amanda Fitzpatrick, Yin Wu, Jenny L C Geh, Hawys Lloyd-Hughes, Lais C G F Palhares, Rebecca Adams, Heather J Bax, Sean Whittaker, Joanna Jacków-Malinowska, Sophia N Karagiannis",Cancers,2024,antibodies; antibody–drug conjugates (ADCs); chimeric-antigen receptors (CAR) T cells; chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 (CSPG4); immunotherapy; melanoma; vaccines,10.3390/cancers16193260,"St. John's Institute of Dermatology, School of Basic & Medical Biosciences & KHP Centre for Translational Medicine, King's College London, London SE1 9RT, UK.; St. John's Institute of Dermatology, School of Basic & Medical Biosciences & KHP Centre for Translational Medicine, King's College London, London SE1 9RT, UK.; St. John's Institute of Dermatology, School of Basic & Medical Biosciences & KHP Centre for Translational Medicine, King's College London, London SE1 9RT, UK.; St. John's Institute of Dermatology, School of Basic & Medical Biosciences & KHP Centre for Translational Medicine, King's College London, London SE1 9RT, UK.; St. John's Institute of Dermatology, School of Basic & Medical Biosciences & KHP Centre for Translational Medicine, King's College London, London SE1 9RT, UK.; St. John's Institute of Dermatology, School of Basic & Medical Biosciences & KHP Centre for Translational Medicine, King's College London, London SE1 9RT, UK.; St. John's Institute of Dermatology, School of Basic & Medical Biosciences & KHP Centre for Translational Medicine, King's College London, London SE1 9RT, UK.; St. John's Institute of Dermatology, School of Basic & Medical Biosciences & KHP Centre for Translational Medicine, King's College London, London SE1 9RT, UK.; St. John's Institute of Dermatology, School of Basic & Medical Biosciences & KHP Centre for Translational Medicine, King's College London, London SE1 9RT, UK.; St. John's Institute of Dermatology, School of Basic & Medical Biosciences & KHP Centre for Translational Medicine, King's College London, London SE1 9RT, UK.; St. John's Institute of Dermatology, School of Basic & Medical Biosciences & KHP Centre for Translational Medicine, King's College London, London SE1 9RT, UK.; St. John's Institute of Dermatology, School of Basic & Medical Biosciences & KHP Centre for Translational Medicine, King's College London, London SE1 9RT, UK.; St John's Institute of Dermatology, Guy's, King's and St. Thomas' Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, London SE1 9RT, UK.; Department of Plastic Surgery, Guy's, King's and St. Thomas' Hospitals, London SE1 9RT, UK.; St. John's Institute of Dermatology, School of Basic & Medical Biosciences & KHP Centre for Translational Medicine, King's College London, London SE1 9RT, UK.; St. John's Institute of Dermatology, School of Basic & Medical Biosciences & KHP Centre for Translational Medicine, King's College London, London SE1 9RT, UK.; St. John's Institute of Dermatology, School of Basic & Medical Biosciences & KHP Centre for Translational Medicine, King's College London, London SE1 9RT, UK.; St. John's Institute of Dermatology, School of Basic & Medical Biosciences & KHP Centre for Translational Medicine, King's College London, London SE1 9RT, UK.; St. John's Institute of Dermatology, School of Basic & Medical Biosciences & KHP Centre for Translational Medicine, King's College London, London SE1 9RT, UK.; St. John's Institute of Dermatology, School of Basic & Medical Biosciences & KHP Centre for Translational Medicine, King's College London, London SE1 9RT, UK.",N/A,"006/R/22 (British Skin Foundation); 24-0087 (Worldwide Cancer Research); C10355/A15587 (CRUK/NIHR in England/DoH for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland Experimental Cancer Medicine Centre); MR/L023091/1; MR/V049445/1; MR/R015643/1 (Medical Research Council); BB/T008709/1 (Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council); C7893/A29290 (the CRUK City of London Centre Award); 147; KCL-BCN-Q3 (Breast Cancer Now); C604/A25135 (the Cancer Research UK King's Health Partners Centre at King's College London); C30122/A11527; C30122/A15774 (Cancer Research UK); 573 (CSP VA); 220589/Z/20/Z (the Wellcome Trust)",Journal Article; Review

39406906,Liver Macrophage Diversity in Health and Disease.,"The liver fulfils a plethora of metabolic and immunological functions. Liver macrophages are a heterogeneous immune cell population with high plasticity and are important for maintaining normal liver function but are also critically involved in disease processes. In this chapter, we review the heterogeneity and multifaceted functions of hepatic macrophages in liver health and in disease conditions, including acute liver injury, chronic liver diseases, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Under homeostatic conditions, the tissue resident Kupffer cells are phagocytic cells that have important functions in immune surveillance, antigen presentation, and metabolic regulation while the roles of other populations such as capsular, peritoneal, or monocyte-derived macrophages in liver health are less clearly defined. Upon liver injury, Kupffer cell numbers are markedly reduced while monocyte-derived macrophages significantly expand and take critical roles in driving and resolving liver injury, including important pathogenic involvements in inflammation, fibrosis, and regeneration. They also create and maintain an immunosuppressive and immune-excluded microenvironment in hepatocellular carcinoma. Single-cell and spatial omics technologies are significantly expanding our understanding of the diversity and plasticity of macrophage populations under different conditions and enable the reliable identification of specific hepatic macrophage subsets. This knowledge can now be applied to dissect the exact contributions of distinct macrophage populations to disease processes and hopefully will pave the way for new therapeutic interventions.","Paul Horn, Frank Tacke",Results and problems in cell differentiation,2024,Acute liver injury; Cancer; HCC; Hepatocellular carcinoma; Kupffer cell; Liver fibrosis; Liver macrophage; MASH; MASLD; NAFLD; NASH; Steatohepatitis,10.1007/978-3-031-65944-7_7,"Department of Hepatology and Gastroenterology, Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Campus Virchow-Klinikum and Campus Charité Mitte, Berlin, Germany.; Department of Hepatology and Gastroenterology, Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Campus Virchow-Klinikum and Campus Charité Mitte, Berlin, Germany. frank.tacke@charite.de.","Humans; Animals; Liver; Macrophages; Liver Diseases; Kupffer Cells; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular",N/A,Journal Article; Review

39393531,Peptidomics and Machine Learning-based Evaluation of Noncoding RNA-Derived Micropeptides in Breast Cancer: Expression Patterns and Functional/Therapeutic Insights.,"Breast cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease characterized by different subtypes arising from molecular alterations that give the disease different phenotypes, clinical behaviors, and prognostic. The noncoding RNA (ncRNA)-derived micropeptides (MPs) represent a novel layer of complexity in cancer study once they can be biologically active and can present potential as biomarkers and also in therapeutics. However, few large-scale studies address the expression of these peptides at the peptidomics level or evaluate their functions and potential in peptide-based therapeutics for breast cancer. In this study, we propose deepening the landscape of ncRNA-derived MPs in breast cancer subtypes and advance the comprehension of the relevance of these molecules to the disease. First, we constructed a 16,349 unique putative MP sequence data set by integrating 2 previously published lists of predicted ncRNA-derived MPs. We evaluated its expression on high-throughput mass spectrometry data of breast tumor samples from different subtypes. Next, we applied several machine and deep learning tools, such as AntiCP 2.0, MULocDeep, PEPstrMOD, Peptipedia, and PreAIP, to predict its functions, cellular localization, tertiary structure, physicochemical features, and other properties related to therapeutics. We identified 58 peptides expressed on breast tissue, including 27 differentially expressed MPs in tumor compared with nontumor samples and MPs exhibiting tumor or subtype specificity. These peptides presented physicochemical features compatible with the canonical proteome and were predicted to influence the tumor immune environment and participate in cell communication, metabolism, and signaling processes. In addition, some MPs presented potential as anticancer, antiinflammatory, and antiangiogenic molecules. Our data demonstrate that MPs derived from ncRNAs have expression patterns associated with specific breast cancer subtypes and tumor specificity, thus highlighting their potential as biomarkers for molecular classification. We also reinforce the relevance of MPs as biologically active molecules that play a role in breast tumorigenesis, besides their potential in peptide-based therapeutics.","Alexandre Luiz Korte de Azevedo, Talita Helen Bombardelli Gomig, Michel Batista, Jaqueline Carvalho de Oliveira, Iglenir João Cavalli, Daniela Fiori Gradia, Enilze Maria de Souza Fonseca Ribeiro",Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,2024,machine learning; micropeptides; noncoding RNAs; subtypes; tumorigenesis,10.1016/j.labinv.2024.102150,"Genetics Post-Graduation Program, Genetics Department, Federal University of Paraná, Curitiba, Brazil.; Genetics Post-Graduation Program, Genetics Department, Federal University of Paraná, Curitiba, Brazil.; Laboratory of Applied Sciences and Technologies in Health, Carlos Chagas Institute, Fiocruz, Curitiba, Brazil; Mass Spectrometry Facility-RPT02H, Carlos Chagas Institute, Fiocruz, Curitiba, Brazil.; Genetics Post-Graduation Program, Genetics Department, Federal University of Paraná, Curitiba, Brazil.; Genetics Post-Graduation Program, Genetics Department, Federal University of Paraná, Curitiba, Brazil.; Genetics Post-Graduation Program, Genetics Department, Federal University of Paraná, Curitiba, Brazil.; Genetics Post-Graduation Program, Genetics Department, Federal University of Paraná, Curitiba, Brazil.

Evidence suggests that the perturbation of this symbiotic host-microbiome relationship contributes to the onset of major diseases such as chronic inflammatory diseases including Inflammatory Bowel Disease. The host glycocalyx (repertoire of glycans/sugar-chains at the surface of gut mucosa) constitutes a major biological and physical interface between the intestinal mucosa and microorganisms, as well as with the host immune system. Glycans are an essential niche for microbiota colonization and thus an important modulator of host-microorganism interactions both in homeostasis and in disease. In this review, we discuss the role of gut mucosa glycome as an instrumental pathway that regulates host-microbiome interactions in homeostasis but also in health to inflammation transition. We also discuss the power of mucosa glycosylation remodelling as an attractive preventive and therapeutic strategy to preserve gut homeostasis.","Lucy I Crouch, Cláudia S Rodrigues, Cassie R Bakshani, Leticia Tavares-Gomes, Joana Gaifem, Salomé S Pinho",Seminars in immunology,2024,Glycans; Host; Human gut microbe; Immune sensing,10.1016/j.smim.2024.101891,"Department of Microbes, Infection and Microbiomes, College of Medicine and Health, University of Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK.

39384907,Deep learning pipeline for automated cell profiling from cyclic imaging.,"Cyclic fluorescence microscopy enables multiple targets to be detected simultaneously. This, in turn, has deepened our understanding of tissue composition, cell-to-cell interactions, and cell signaling. Unfortunately, analysis of these datasets can be time-prohibitive due to the sheer volume of data. In this paper, we present CycloNET, a computational pipeline tailored for analyzing raw fluorescent images obtained through cyclic immunofluorescence. The automated pipeline pre-processes raw image files, quickly corrects for translation errors between imaging cycles, and leverages a pre-trained neural network to segment individual cells and generate single-cell molecular profiles. We applied CycloNET to a dataset of 22 human samples from head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients and trained a neural network to segment immune cells. CycloNET efficiently processed a large-scale dataset (17 fields of view per cycle and 13 staining cycles per specimen) in 10 min, delivering insights at the single-cell resolution and facilitating the identification of rare immune cell clusters. We expect that this rapid pipeline will serve as a powerful tool to understand complex biological systems at the cellular level, with the potential to facilitate breakthroughs in areas such as developmental biology, disease pathology, and personalized medicine.","Christian Landeros, Juhyun Oh, Ralph Weissleder, Hakho Lee",Scientific reports,2024,Cell segmentation; Cyclic microscopy; Imaging analysis; Machine learning; Software,10.1038/s41598-024-74597-w,"Center for Systems Biology, Massachusetts General Hospital, 185 Cambridge St, CPZN 5206, Boston, MA, 02114, USA.; Center for Systems Biology, Massachusetts General Hospital, 185 Cambridge St, CPZN 5206, Boston, MA, 02114, USA.; Center for Systems Biology, Massachusetts General Hospital, 185 Cambridge St, CPZN 5206, Boston, MA, 02114, USA. rweissleder@mgh.harvard.edu.; Center for Systems Biology, Massachusetts General Hospital, 185 Cambridge St, CPZN 5206, Boston, MA, 02114, USA. hlee@mgh.harvard.edu.","Humans; Deep Learning; Microscopy, Fluorescence; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Single-Cell Analysis; Neural Networks, Computer; Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck; Head and Neck Neoplasms",U01 CA279858 (NCI NIH HHS); R01 CA239078 (NCI NIH HHS); R01 HL163513 (NHLBI NIH HHS); U01CA279858 (NCI NIH HHS); R21 CA267222 (NCI NIH HHS); R01 CA264363 (NCI NIH HHS); U01 CA284982 (NCI NIH HHS); R01 CA237500 (NCI NIH HHS),Journal Article

39384770,The multiple roles of interferon regulatory factor family in health and disease.,"Interferon Regulatory Factors (IRFs), a family of transcription factors, profoundly influence the immune system, impacting both physiological and pathological processes. This review explores the diverse functions of nine mammalian IRF members, each featuring conserved domains essential for interactions with other transcription factors and cofactors. These interactions allow IRFs to modulate a broad spectrum of physiological processes, encompassing host defense, immune response, and cell development. Conversely, their pivotal role in immune regulation implicates them in the pathophysiology of various diseases, such as infectious diseases, autoimmune disorders, metabolic diseases, and cancers. In this context, IRFs display a dichotomous nature, functioning as both tumor suppressors and promoters, contingent upon the specific disease milieu. Post-translational modifications of IRFs, including phosphorylation and ubiquitination, play a crucial role in modulating their function, stability, and activation. As prospective biomarkers and therapeutic targets, IRFs present promising opportunities for disease intervention. Further research is needed to elucidate the precise mechanisms governing IRF regulation, potentially pioneering innovative therapeutic strategies, particularly in cancer treatment, where the equilibrium of IRF activities is of paramount importance.","Lian Wang, Yanghui Zhu, Nan Zhang, Yali Xian, Yu Tang, Jing Ye, Fekrazad Reza, Gu He, Xiang Wen, Xian Jiang",Signal transduction and targeted therapy,2024,N/A,10.1038/s41392-024-01980-4,"Department of Dermatology & Venerology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, 610041, China.; Department of Dermatology & Venerology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, 610041, China.; State Key Laboratory of Southwestern Chinese Medicine Resources, School of Pharmacy, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, 611137, China.; Department of Dermatology & Venerology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, 610041, China.; Department of Dermatology & Venerology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, 610041, China.; Department of Dermatology & Venerology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, 610041, China.; Radiation Sciences Research Center, Laser Research Center in Medical Sciences, AJA University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.; Department of Dermatology & Venerology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, 610041, China.; Department of Dermatology & Venerology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, 610041, China. wenxiang@wchscu.edu.cn.; Department of Dermatology & Venerology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, 610041, China. jiangxian@scu.edu.cn.","Humans; Interferon Regulatory Factors; Neoplasms; Protein Processing, Post-Translational; Autoimmune Diseases; Ubiquitination; Animals; Phosphorylation",82273559 (National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science Foundation of China)); 82103757 (National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science Foundation of China)),Journal Article; Review

The metabolic regulation of the immune system is important in the pathogenesis and progression of numerous diseases, such as cancers, autoimmune diseases and metabolic diseases. The concept of immunometabolism was introduced over a decade ago to elucidate the intricate interplay between metabolism and immunity. The definition of immunometabolism has expanded from chronic low-grade inflammation in metabolic diseases to metabolic reprogramming of immune cells in various diseases. With immunometabolism being proposed and developed, the metabolic regulation of the immune system can be gradually summarized and becomes more and more clearer. In the context of many diseases including cancer, autoimmune diseases, metabolic diseases, and many other disease, metabolic reprogramming occurs in immune cells inducing proinflammatory or anti-inflammatory effects. The phenotypic and functional changes of immune cells caused by metabolic regulation further affect and development of diseases. Based on experimental results, targeting cellular metabolism of immune cells becomes a promising therapy. In this review, we focus on immune cells to introduce their metabolic pathways and metabolic reprogramming, and summarize how these metabolic pathways affect immune effects in the context of diseases. We thoroughly explore targets and treatments based on immunometabolism in existing studies. The challenges of translating experimental results into clinical applications in the field of immunometabolism are also summarized.

39375792,School health services in the Southern District of Israel-between privatization and nationalization.,"For decades, Israel's economic policy has favored either outsourcing or privatization of public services, including healthcare, generating an ongoing and prolonged debate of this approach. In 1997 school health services (SHS) for elementary and middle school pupils was outsourced to a sub-contractor firm, reducing budget, but also standards, for nurses and physicians.

39372800,Biologically-informed Killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) gene annotation tool.,"Natural killer (NK) cells are essential components of the innate immune system, with their activity significantly regulated by Killer cell Immunoglobulin-like Receptors (KIRs). The diversity and structural complexity of KIR genes present significant challenges for accurate genotyping, essential for understanding NK cell functions and their implications in health and disease. Traditional genotyping methods struggle with the variable nature of KIR genes, leading to inaccuracies that can impede immunogenetic research. These challenges extend to high-quality phased assemblies, which have been recently popularized by the Human Pangenome Consortium. This paper introduces BAKIR (Biologically-informed Annotator for KIR locus), a tailored computational tool designed to overcome the challenges of KIR genotyping and annotation on high-quality, phased genome assemblies. BAKIR aims to enhance the accuracy of KIR gene annotations by structuring its annotation pipeline around identifying key functional mutations, thereby improving the identification and subsequent relevance of gene and allele calls. It uses a multi-stage mapping, alignment, and variant calling process to ensure high-precision gene and allele identification, while also maintaining high recall for sequences that are significantly mutated or truncated relative to the known allele database. BAKIR has been evaluated on a subset of the HPRC assemblies, where BAKIR was able to improve many of the associated annotations and call novel variants. BAKIR is freely available on GitHub, offering ease of access and use through multiple installation methods, including pip, conda, and singularity container, and is equipped with a user-friendly command-line interface, thereby promoting its adoption in the scientific community.","Michael K B Ford, Ananth Hari, Qinghui Zhou, Ibrahim Numanagić, S Cenk Sahinalp",bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology,2024,N/A,10.1101/2024.08.13.607835,"National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA.; National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA.; University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada.; University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada.; National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA.",N/A,N/A,Journal Article; Preprint

39369283,Considerations for widespread implementation of blood-based biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease.,"Diagnosing Alzheimer's disease (AD) poses significant challenges to health care, often resulting in delayed or inadequate patient care. The clinical integration of blood-based biomarkers (BBMs) for AD holds promise in enabling early detection of pathology and timely intervention. However, several critical considerations, such as the lack of consistent guidelines for assessing cognition, limited understanding of BBM test characteristics, insufficient evidence on BBM performance across diverse populations, and the ethical management of test results, must be addressed for widespread clinical implementation of BBMs in the United States. The Global CEO Initiative on Alzheimer's Disease BBM Workgroup convened to address these challenges and provide recommendations that underscore the importance of evidence-based guidelines, improved training for health-care professionals, patient empowerment through informed decision making, and the necessity of community-based studies to understand BBM performance in real-world populations.

39367472,"Infusion parameters, safety, and practical guidance for the manual administration of subcutaneous immunoglobulin 20% (Ig20Gly).","Primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDs), also referred to as inborn errors of immunity, constitute a group of genetic conditions that affect the immune system. The current standard of care for patients with PIDs is lifelong immunoglobulin replacement therapy, delivered by intravenous (IVIG) or subcutaneous (SCIG) infusion. Immune globulin subcutaneous (human) 20% solution stabilized with glycine (Ig20Gly) is indicated as a replacement therapy for PIDs in adults and children of any age in Europe and in patients aged 2 years and above in the USA. Typically, Ig20Gly is administered using an infusion pump; however, delivery of Ig20Gly by manual administration has recently been approved in Europe. Practical recommendations on the use of Ig20Gly manual administration are lacking; this review therefore aims to provide guidance for use of this method of administration. Additionally, we summarize the infusion parameters, safety, patient-reported outcomes, and economic benefits associated with Ig20Gly manual administration. Manual administration of Ig20Gly was shown to permit faster rates of infusion than administration via infusion pump. Patients typically infused at two or fewer infusion sites with manual administration of Ig20Gly. Safety and tolerability profiles were similar for Ig20Gly manual administration and administration by infusion pump. Overall, there were comparable levels of patient satisfaction with manual administration and infusion pump, with patient preference deemed to be a key determinator of success for either method of administration. Economic studies identified cost savings for the healthcare system through manual administration compared with IVIG or SCIG infusion by infusion pump because of the reduced equipment costs and nurse support. For infusion of Ig20Gly by manual administration, a syringe and butterfly needle are used; patients are advised to start infusion at 1-2 mL/min to prevent discomfort. Overall, manual administration of Ig20Gly offers an effective and well-tolerated alternative to administration by infusion pump.","Dorothea Grosse-Kreul, Crystal Allen, Chrystyna Kalicinsky, Paul K Keith","Allergy, asthma, and clinical immunology : official journal of the Canadian Society of Allergy and Clinical Immunology",2024,Home infusion; Inborn errors of immunity; Manual push; Primary immunodeficiencies; Rapid push; SCIG 20%; Treatment individualization,10.1186/s13223-024-00914-7,"School of Immunology and Microbial Sciences, Department of Immunological Medicine and Allergy, King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, King's Health Partners, London, UK. d.grosse-kreul@nhs.net.; Clinical Epidemiology Program, The Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, ON, Canada.; Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada.; Division of Clinical Immunology and Allergy, Department of Medicine, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada.",N/A,N/A,Journal Article; Review

39364834,"The importance of IgG glycosylation-What did we learn after analyzing over 100,000 individuals.","All four subclasses of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies have glycan structures attached to the protein part of the IgG molecules. Glycans linked to the Fc portion of IgG are found in all IgG antibodies, while about one-fifth of IgG antibodies in plasma also have glycans attached to the Fab portion of IgG. The IgG3 subclass is characterized by more complex glycosylation compared to other IgG subclasses. In this review, we discuss the significant influence that glycans exert on the structural and functional properties of IgG. We provide a comprehensive overview of how the composition of these glycans can affect IgG's effector functions by modulating its interactions with Fcγ receptors and other molecules such as the C1q component of complement, which in turn influence various immune responses triggered by IgG, including antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). In addition, the importance of glycans for the efficacy of therapeutics like monoclonal antibodies and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) therapy is discussed. Moreover, we offer insights into IgG glycosylation characteristics and roles derived from general population, disease-specific, and interventional studies. These studies indicate that IgG glycans are important biomarkers and functional effectors in health and disease.","Jasminka Krištić, Gordan Lauc",Immunological reviews,2024,ADCC; CDC; Fcγ receptors; IVIg; IgG; glycosylation,10.1111/imr.13407,"Genos Glycoscience Research Laboratory, Zagreb, Croatia.; Genos Glycoscience Research Laboratory, Zagreb, Croatia.",N/A,101071386 (HORIZON EUROPE European Research Council); 101159018 (HORIZON EUROPE Framework Programme); 101057438 (HORIZON EUROPE Framework Programme),Journal Article; Review

Under physiological conditions, microglia support and modulate neurogenesis through the secretion of neurotrophic factors, phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, and synaptic pruning, thereby promoting the proliferation, differentiation, and survival of neural progenitor cells (NPCs). However, in AD, microglial function becomes dysregulated, leading to chronic neuroinflammation and impaired neurogenesis. This review explores the intricate interplay between microglia and adult neurogenesis in health and AD, synthesizing recent findings to provide a comprehensive overview of the current understanding of microglia-mediated regulation of adult neurogenesis.

39352304,Ccl2-Induced Regulatory T Cells Balance Inflammation Through Macrophage Polarization During Liver Reconstitution.,"Inflammation is highlighted as an initial factor that helps orchestrate liver reconstitution. However, the precise mechanisms controlling inflammation during liver reconstitution have not been fully elucidated. In this study, a clear immune response is demonstrated during hepatic reconstitution. Inhibition of the hepatic inflammatory response retards liver regeneration. During this process, Ccl2 is primarily produced by type 1 innate lymphoid cells (ILC1s), and ILC1-derived Ccl2 recruits peripheral ILC1s and regulatory T cells (Tregs) to the liver. Deletion of Ccl2 or Tregs exacerbates hepatic injury and inflammatory cytokine release, accelerating liver proliferation and regeneration. The adoption of Tregs and IL-10 injection reversed these effects on hepatocyte regenerative proliferation. Additionally, Treg-derived IL-10 can directly induce macrophage polarization from M1 to M2, which alleviated macrophage-secreted IL-6 and TNF-α and balanced the intrahepatic inflammatory milieu during liver reconstitution. This study reveals the capacity of Tregs to modulate the intrahepatic inflammatory milieu and liver reconstitution through IL-10-mediated macrophage polarization, providing a potential opportunity to improve hepatic inflammation and maintain homeostasis.","Rui Wang, Qing Liang, Qian Zhang, Shuchao Zhao, Yuxiang Lin, Bing Liu, Yinjiang Ma, Xiaoya Mai, Quanze Fu, Xiaorui Bao, Nan Wang, Binglin Chen, Peng Yan, Yongsheng Zhu, Kejia Wang","Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)",2024,inflammatory milieu; liver reconstitution; macrophage polarization; regulatory T cell; type 1 innate lymphoid cell,10.1002/advs.202403849,"Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University, State Key Laboratory of Cellular Stress Biology, Cancer Research Center, School of Medicine, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, 361102, China.; Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University, State Key Laboratory of Cellular Stress Biology, Cancer Research Center, School of Medicine, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, 361102, China.; Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University, State Key Laboratory of Cellular Stress Biology, Cancer Research Center, School of Medicine, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, 361102, China.; Department of Pathology, The Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University, Qingdao, Shandong, 266000, China.; Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University, State Key Laboratory of Cellular Stress Biology, Cancer Research Center, School of Medicine, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, 361102, China.; Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University, State Key Laboratory of Cellular Stress Biology, Cancer Research Center, School of Medicine, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, 361102, China.; Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University, State Key Laboratory of Cellular Stress Biology, Cancer Research Center, School of Medicine, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, 361102, China.; Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University, State Key Laboratory of Cellular Stress Biology, Cancer Research Center, School of Medicine, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, 361102, China.; Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University, State Key Laboratory of Cellular Stress Biology, Cancer Research Center, School of Medicine, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, 361102, China.; Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University, State Key Laboratory of Cellular Stress Biology, Cancer Research Center, School of Medicine, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, 361102, China.; Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University, State Key Laboratory of Cellular Stress Biology, Cancer Research Center, School of Medicine, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, 361102, China.; Department of Dermatology, Zhongshan Hospital Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, 361102, China.; NHC Key Laboratory of Forensic Science, National Biosafety Evidence Foundation, College of Forensic Science, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, 710061, China.; NHC Key Laboratory of Forensic Science, National Biosafety Evidence Foundation, College of Forensic Science, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, 710061, China.; Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University, State Key Laboratory of Cellular Stress Biology, Cancer Research Center, School of Medicine, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, 361102, China.",N/A,92374105 (National Natural Science Foundation of China); 32322029 (National Natural Science Foundation of China); 82372785 (National Natural Science Foundation of China); 2024J09004 (Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province); 2022J01011 (Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province); 20720230069 (Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); 20720240115 (Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),Journal Article
39351983,Molecular mechanisms of emerging inflammasome complexes and their activation and signaling in inflammation and pyroptosis.,"Inflammasomes are multi-protein complexes that assemble within the cytoplasm of mammalian cells in response to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), driving the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18, and pyroptosis. The best-characterized inflammasome complexes are the NLRP3, NAIP-NLRC4, NLRP1, AIM2, and Pyrin canonical caspase-1-containing inflammasomes, and the caspase-11 non-canonical inflammasome. Newer inflammasome sensor proteins have been identified, including NLRP6, NLRP7, NLRP9, NLRP10, NLRP11, NLRP12, CARD8, and MxA. These inflammasome sensors can sense PAMPs from bacteria, viruses and protozoa, or DAMPs in the form of mitochondrial damage, ROS, stress and heme. The mechanisms of action, physiological relevance, consequences in human diseases, and avenues for therapeutic intervention for these novel inflammasomes are beginning to be realized. Here, we discuss these emerging inflammasome complexes and their putative activation mechanisms, molecular and signaling pathways, and physiological roles in health and disease.","Abhimanu Pandey, Zheyi Li, Manjul Gautam, Aritra Ghosh, Si Ming Man",Immunological reviews,2024,PANoptosis; PANoptosome; autoimmunity; autoinflammation; bacteria; cancer; caspase‐1; caspase‐11; caspase‐4; caspase‐5; cell death; cytokines; gasdermin D; immunity; infection; inflammatory caspases; interferons; lipopolysaccharide; parasites; pattern‐recognition receptors; viruses,10.1111/imr.13406,"Division of Immunology and Infectious Diseases, The John Curtin School of Medical Research, The Australian National University, Canberra, Australia.; Division of Immunology and Infectious Diseases, The John Curtin School of Medical Research, The Australian National University, Canberra, Australia.; Division of Immunology and Infectious Diseases, The John Curtin School of Medical Research, The Australian National University, Canberra, Australia.; Division of Immunology and Infectious Diseases, The John Curtin School of Medical Research, The Australian National University, Canberra, Australia.; Division of Immunology and Infectious Diseases, The John Curtin School of Medical Research, The Australian National University, Canberra, Australia.",N/A,AIRXV000005 (The Australian Government Australia-India Strategic Research Fund Collaborative Research Project); 2026910 (National Health and Medical Research Council); APP2002686 (National Health and Medical Research Council),Journal Article; Review
39351838,Recommendations for clinical implementation of blood-based biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease.,"Blood-based biomarkers (BBM) for Alzheimer's disease (AD) are being increasingly used in clinical practice to support an AD diagnosis. In contrast to traditional diagnostic modalities, such as amyloid positron emission tomography and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, BBMs offer a more accessible and lower cost alternative for AD biomarker testing. Their unique scalability addresses the anticipated surge in demand for biomarker testing with the emergence of disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) that require confirmation of amyloid pathology. To facilitate the uptake of BBMs in clinical practice, The Global CEO Initiative on Alzheimer's Disease convened a BBM Workgroup to provide recommendations for two clinical implementational pathways for BBMs: one for current use for triaging and another for future use to confirm amyloid pathology. These pathways provide a standardized diagnostic approach with guidance on interpreting BBM test results. Integrating BBMs into clinical practice will simplify the diagnostic process and facilitate timely access to DMTs for eligible patients.","Michelle M Mielke, Matthew Anderson, J Wesson Ashford, Andreas Jeromin, Pei-Jung Lin, Allyson Rosen, Jamie Tyrone, Lawren Vandevrede, Deanna R Willis, Oskar Hansson, Ara S Khachaturian, Suzanne E Schindler, Joan Weiss, Richard Batrla, Sasha Bozeat, John R Dwyer, Drew Holzapfel, Daryl Rhys Jones, James F Murray, Katherine A Partrick, Emily Scholler, George Vradenburg, Dylan Young, Joel B Braunstein, Samantha C Burnham, Fabricio Ferreira de Oliveira, Yan Helen Hu, Soeren Mattke, Zul Merali, Mark Monane, Marwan Noel Sabbagh, Eli Shobin, Michael Weiner, Chinedu T Udeh-Momoh",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association,2024,Alzheimer's disease; amyloid; biomarker; blood‐based biomarkers; clinical implementation; clinical practice; cognitive impairment; disease‐modifying treatment; patient journey; primary care; secondary care,10.1002/alz.14184,"Department of Epidemiology and Prevention, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, USA.; Atrium Health, Charlotte, North Carolina, USA.; Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA.; ALZpath, Carlsbad, California, USA.; Center for the Evaluation of Value and Risk in Health Institute for Clinical Research and Health Policy Studies, Tufts Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.; Palo Alto Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Palo Alto, California, USA.; Patient Advocate, Sacramento, California, USA.; Memory and Aging Center, Department of Neurology, University of California, San Francisco, California, USA.; Department of Family Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.; Clinical Memory Research Unit, Department of Clinical Sciences Malmö, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.; The Campaign to Prevent Alzheimer's Disease, Rockville, Maryland, USA.; Department of Neurology, Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, USA.; US Department of Health and Human Services, Health Resources and Services Administration, Bureau of Health Workforce, Rockville, Maryland, USA.; Eisai Inc, Nutley, New Jersey, USA.; F.

39351758,Role of apoptosis repressor with caspase recruitment domain in human health and chronic diseases.,"Apoptosis repressor with caspase recruitment domain (ARC) is a highly potent and multifunctional suppressor of various types of programmed cell death (PCD) (e.g. apoptosis, necroptosis, and pyroptosis) and plays a key role in determining cell fate. Under physiological conditions, ARC is predominantly expressed in terminally differentiated cells, such as cardiomyocytes and skeletal muscle cells. Its expression and activity are tightly controlled by a complicated system consisting of transcription factor (TF), non-coding RNA (ncRNA), and post-translational modification (PTM). ARC dysregulation has been shown to be closely associated with many chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, and neurodegenerative disease. However, the detailed mechanisms of ARC involved in the progression of these diseases remain unclear to a large extent. In this review, we mainly focus on the regulatory mechanisms of ARC expression and activity and its role in PCD. We also discuss the underlying mechanisms of ARC in health and disease and highlight the potential implications of ARC in the clinical treatment of patients with chronic diseases. This information may assist in developing ARC-based therapeutic strategies for patients with chronic diseases and expand researchers' understanding of ARC.","Xiang Ao, Guoqiang Ji, Bingqiang Zhang, Wei Ding, Jianxun Wang, Ying Liu, Junqiang Xue",Annals of medicine,2024,ARC; apoptosis; chronic diseases; therapeutic target,10.1080/07853890.2024.2409958,"Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University, Qingdao, Shandong, P.R.

39351440,Hematopoietic and leukemic stem cells homeostasis: the role of bone marrow niche.,"The bone marrow microenvironment (BMM) has highly specialized anatomical characteristics that provide a sanctuary place for hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) that allow appropriate proliferation, maintenance, and self-renewal capacity. Several cell types contribute to the constitution and function of the bone marrow niche. Interestingly, uncovering the secrets of BMM and its interaction with HSCs in health paved the road for research aiming at better understanding the concept of leukemic stem cells (LSCs) and their altered niche. In fact, they share many signals that are responsible for interactions between LSCs and the bone marrow niche, due to several biological similarities between LSCs and HSCs. On the other hand, LSCs differ from HSCs in their abnormal activation of important signaling pathways that regulate survival, proliferation, drug resistance, invasion, and spread. Targeting these altered niches can help in better treatment choices for hematological malignancies and bone marrow disorders in general and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in particular. Moreover, targeting those niches may help in decreasing the emergence of drug resistance and lower the relapse rate. In this article, the authors reviewed the most recent literature on bone marrow niches and their relations with either normal HSCs and AML cells/LSC, by focusing on pathogenetic and therapeutic implications.","Shaimaa Khattab, Manal El Sorady, Ashraf El-Ghandour, Giuseppe Visani, Pier Paolo Piccaluga",Exploration of targeted anti-tumor therapy,2024,Hematopoietic stem cell; acute myeloid leukemia; bone marrow niche; drug resistance; immune system; precision medicine; targeted therapy,10.37349/etat.2024.00262,"Biobank of Research, IRCCS Azienda Ospedaliera-Universitaria di Bologna Policlinico di S.

39345481,Selective loss of Y chromosomes in lung adenocarcinoma modulates the tumor immune environment through cancer/testis antigens.,"There is increasing recognition that the sex chromosomes, X and Y, play an important role in health and disease that goes beyond the determination of biological sex. Loss of the Y chromosome (LOY) in blood, which occurs naturally in aging men, has been found to be a driver of cardiac fibrosis and heart failure mortality. LOY also occurs in most solid tumors in males and is often associated with worse survival, suggesting that LOY may give tumor cells a growth or survival advantage. We analyzed LOY in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) using both bulk and single-cell expression data and found evidence suggesting that LOY affects the tumor immune environment by altering cancer/testis antigen expression and consequently facilitating tumor immune evasion. Analyzing immunotherapy data, we show that LOY and changes in expression of particular cancer/testis antigens are associated with response to pembrolizumab treatment and outcome, providing a new and powerful biomarker for predicting immunotherapy response in LUAD tumors in males.","Jonas Fischer, Katherine H Shutta, Chen Chen, Viola Fanfani, Enakshi Saha, Panagiotis Mandros, Marouen Ben Guebila, Joanne Xiu, Jorge Nieva, Stephen Liu, Dipesh Uprety, David Spetzler, Camila M Lopes-Ramos, Dawn DeMeo, John Quackenbush",bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology,2024,cancer; immune evasion; loss of Y; lung adenocarcinoma,10.1101/2024.09.19.613876,"Department of Biostatistics, Harvard T.H.

39343440,Community engagement and local governance for health equity through trust: lessons from developing the CONNECT Initiative in the Lao People's Democratic Republic.,"Community engagement and local governance are important components of health interventions aiming to empower local populations. Yet, there is limited evidence on how to effectively engage with communities and codevelop interventions, especially in Southeast Asian contexts. Despite rapid progress, the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) still has high maternal and child mortality, with essential service coverage showing significant disparities across socioeconomic strata. Long-standing challenges in community health were exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and reinforced by poor trust between users and health providers. However, the pandemic also provided an opportunity to develop approaches for enhanced community engagement and local governance capacity to tackle health inequities. The Community Network Engagement for Essential Healthcare and COVID-19 Responses through Trust (CONNECT) Initiative, developed by the Lao PDR government, WHO and partners, has resulted in initial positive outcomes in community health such as increased vaccination uptake, facility births and trust in health providers. This case study describes the iterative, adaptive process by which the CONNECT Initiative was developed, and how the core components, key stakeholders, theory of change and evaluation framework evolved from grounded observations and hypotheses. Lessons learnt include (1) awareness of entry points and existing structures to strengthen local governance for health through mutually beneficial intersectoral collaboration; (2) building relationships and trust with an adaptive, grounds-up approach for sustainability and scalability.

39340060,Pertussis Epidemiology in Children: The Role of Maternal Immunization.,"In the last twelve months, a significant global increase in pertussis cases has been observed, particularly among infants under three months of age. This age group is at the highest risk for severe disease, hospitalization, and death. Maternal immunization with the Tdap vaccine during pregnancy has been recommended to protect newborns by transferring maternal antibodies transplacentally. This review examines the current epidemiology of pertussis, the importance of preventing it in young children, and the effectiveness of maternal immunization. Despite the proven benefits of maternal vaccination, which has been found effective in pertussis prevention in up to 90% of cases, coverage remains suboptimal in many countries.

39340059,Chagas Disease Diagnosis with ,"Serological tests are critical tools in the fight against infectious disease. They detect antibodies produced during an adaptive immune response against a pathogen with an immunological reagent, whose antibody binding characteristics define the specificity and sensitivity of the assay. While pathogen proteins have conveniently served as reagents, their performance is limited by the natural grouping of specific and non-specific antibody binding sites, epitopes. An attractive solution is to build synthetic proteins that only contains pathogen-specific epitopes, which could theoretically reach 100% specificity. However, the genesis of de novo proteins remains a challenge. To address the uncertainty of producing a synthetic protein, we have repurposed the beta barrel of fluorescent proteins into a receptacle that can receive several epitope sequences without compromising its ability to be expressed. Here, two versions of a multiepitope protein were built using the receptacle that differ by their grouping of epitopes specific to the parasite ","Andressa da M Durans, Paloma Napoleão-Pêgo, Flavia C G Reis, Evandro R Dias, Luciana E S F Machado, Guilherme C Lechuga, Angela C V Junqueira, Salvatore G De-Simone, David W Provance",Vaccines,2024,Chagas disease; ELISA; Green Fluorescent Protein; Serodiagnosis; Trypanosoma cruzi,10.3390/vaccines12091029,"Center for Technological Development in Health, National Institute of Science and Technology for Innovation in Neglected Population Diseases, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro 21040-900, Brazil.; Center for Technological Development in Health, National Institute of Science and Technology for Innovation in Neglected Population Diseases, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro 21040-900, Brazil.; Center for Technological Development in Health, National Institute of Science and Technology for Innovation in Neglected Population Diseases, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro 21040-900, Brazil.; Center for Technological Development in Health, National Institute of Science and Technology for Innovation in Neglected Population Diseases, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro 21040-900, Brazil.; Center for Technological Development in Health, National Institute of Science and Technology for Innovation in Neglected Population Diseases, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro 21040-900, Brazil.; Center for Technological Development in Health, National Institute of Science and Technology for Innovation in Neglected Population Diseases, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro 21040-900, Brazil.; Laboratory on Parasitic Diseases, Oswaldo Cruz Institute, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro 21040-900, Brazil.; Center for Technological Development in Health, National Institute of Science and Technology for Innovation in Neglected Population Diseases, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro 21040-900, Brazil.; Center for Technological Development in Health, National Institute of Science and Technology for Innovation in Neglected Population Diseases, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro 21040-900, Brazil.",N/A,(#SEI26003/01279/2021 (Fundação Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro); 200.960/2022 (Fundação Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro); 305157-2020-5 (National Council for Scientific and Technological Development); Inova VPPIS-004-FIO-18-52 (Fundação Oswaldo Cruz),Journal Article

39338992,Gut Microbiota in Patients Receiving Dialysis: A Review.,"The human gut microbiota constitutes a complex community of microorganisms residing within the gastrointestinal tract, encompassing a vast array of species that play crucial roles in health and disease. The disease processes involved in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) are now increasingly established to result in dysregulation of gut microbiota composition and function. Gut microbiota dysbiosis has been associated with poor clinical outcomes and all-cause mortality in patients with ESKD, particularly individuals receiving dialysis. Prior studies highlighted various factors that affect gut microbiota dysbiosis in CKD and ESKD. These include, but are not limited to, uraemic toxin accumulation, chronic inflammation, immune dysfunction, medications, and dietary restrictions and nutritional status. There is a lack of studies at present that focus on the evaluation of gut microbiota dysbiosis in the context of dialysis. Knowledge on gut microbiota changes in this context is important for determining their impact on dialysis-specific and overall outcomes for this patient cohort. More importantly, evaluating gut microbiota composition can provide information into potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Identification of specific microbial signatures may result in further development of personalised treatments to improve patient outcomes and mitigate complications during dialysis. Optimising gut microbiota through various therapeutic approaches, including dietary adjustments, probiotics, prebiotics, medications, and faecal transplantation, have previously demonstrated potential in multiple medical conditions. It remains to be seen whether these therapeutic approaches are effective within the dialysis setting. Our review aims to evaluate evidence relating to alterations in the gut microbiota of patients undergoing dialysis. A growing body of evidence pointing to the complex yet significant relationship which surrounds gut microbiota and kidney health emphasises the importance of gut microbial balance to improve outcomes for individuals receiving dialysis.","Xintian Lim, Lijin Ooi, Uzhe Ding, Henry H L Wu, Rajkumar Chinnadurai","Pathogens (Basel, Switzerland)",2024,chronic kidney disease; dialysis; end-stage kidney disease; gut microbiota,10.3390/pathogens13090801,"Department of Renal Medicine, Northern Care Alliance NHS Foundation Trust, Salford M6 8HD, UK.; Department of Renal Medicine, Northern Care Alliance NHS Foundation Trust, Salford M6 8HD, UK.; Department of Renal Medicine, Northern Care Alliance NHS Foundation Trust, Salford M6 8HD, UK.; Renal Research Laboratory, Kolling Institute of Medical Research, Royal North Shore Hospital, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2065, Australia.; Department of Renal Medicine, Northern Care Alliance NHS Foundation Trust, Salford M6 8HD, UK.",N/A,N/A,Journal Article; Review

39335922,Immunomodulatory Mechanisms of Tea Leaf Polysaccharide in Mice with Cyclophosphamide-Induced Immunosuppression Based on Gut Flora and Metabolomics.,"Tea polysaccharides (TPSs) are receiving increasing attention because of their diverse pharmacological and biological activities. Here, we explored the immunoregulatory mechanisms of TPSs from fresh tea leaves in a mouse model of cyclophosphamide (CTX)-induced immunosuppression in terms of gut microbiota and metabolites. We observed that TPSs significantly increased the body weight and alleviated CTX-induced thymus atrophy in the immunosuppressed mice; they also increased the plasma levels of immunoglobulins A and M, interleukin (IL) 1β, IL-6, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and tumor necrosis factor α. Furthermore, we conducted 16S rDNA sequencing of cecal contents, resulting in the acquisition of 5008 high-quality bacterial 16S rDNA gene reads from the sequencing of mouse fecal samples. By analyzing the data, we found that TPSs regulated the gut microbiota structure and diversity and alleviated the CTX-induced dysregulation of gut microbiota. The colonic contents of mice were subjected to analysis using the UPLC-Q-TOF/MS/MS technique for the purpose of untargeted metabolomics. In the course of our metabolite identification analysis, we identified a total of 2685 metabolites in positive ion mode and 1655 metabolites in negative ion mode. The analysis of these metabolites indicated that TPSs improved CTX-induced metabolic disorders by regulating the levels of metabolites related to tryptophan, arginine, and proline metabolism. In conclusion, TPSs can alleviate CTX-induced immunosuppression by regulating the structural composition of gut microbiota, indicating the applicability of TPSs as novel innate immune modulators in health foods or medicines.","Qiaoyi Zhou, Jinjing Gao, Xueyan Sun, Junyuan Du, Zhiyi Wu, Dongxia Liang, Caijin Ling, Binghu Fang","Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",2024,gut microbiota flora; immune regulation; metabolomic; tea polysaccharide,10.3390/foods13182994,"Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Tea Plant Resources Innovation and Utilization, Tea Research Institute, Guangdong Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Guangzhou 510640, China.; National Reference Laboratory of Veterinary Drug Residues, College of Veterinary Medicine, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510640, China.; National Reference Laboratory of Veterinary Drug Residues, College of Veterinary Medicine, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510640, China.; National Reference Laboratory of Veterinary Drug Residues, College of Veterinary Medicine, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510640, China.; National Reference Laboratory of Veterinary Drug Residues, College of Veterinary Medicine, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510640, China.; Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Tea Plant Resources Innovation and Utilization, Tea Research Institute, Guangdong Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Guangzhou 510640, China.; Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Tea Plant Resources Innovation and Utilization, Tea Research Institute, Guangdong Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Guangzhou 510640, China.; National Reference Laboratory of Veterinary Drug Residues, College of Veterinary Medicine, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510640, China.",N/A,"2021CX03 (Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Tea Plant Resources Innovation and Utilization Innova-tion Fund Project); 2019BT02N054 (Research Teams Project of Guangdong Pearl River Talents Program, China); 202202 (Wellcome Trust); 2021030 (Heyuan City Science and Technology plan project)",Journal Article

Nasal and fecal swabs from neonatal calves, weaned calves, and fresh cows were analyzed for BCoV using RT-PCR, and blood and bulk milk samples were collected for BCoV antibody levels using ELISA. Multiple logistic regression models with random effects of herds were used to evaluate the herd health status, husbandry, management, and biosecurity associated with BCoV shedding (nasal and/or fecal PCR positive samples) in neonatal and weaned calves. BCoV was detected in 80% of herds and in 24% of neonatal calves, 23% of weaned calves, and 5% of fresh cows. The biosecurity scored on 109 dairies with Biocheck.Ugent was, on average, 60% (external score 71%, internal score 47%), and there was no clear association between various biosecurity measures on BCoV shedding in calves. Dry cow vaccination against BCoV reduced shedding in neonatal calves, whereas it was linked to increased shedding in weaned calves in these farms.

39333753,Induced pluripotent stem cell-derived macrophages as a platform for modelling human disease.,"Macrophages are innate immune cells that are present in essentially all tissues, where they have vital roles in tissue development, homeostasis and pathogenesis. The importance of macrophages in tissue function is reflected by their association with various human diseases, and studying macrophage functions in both homeostasis and pathological tissue settings is a promising avenue for new targeted therapies that will improve human health. The ability to generate macrophages from induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells has revolutionized macrophage biology, with the generation of iPS cell-derived macrophages (iMacs) providing unlimited access to genotype-specific cells that can be used to model various human diseases involving macrophage dysregulation. Such disease modelling is achieved by generating iPS cells from patient-derived cells carrying disease-related mutations or by introducing mutations into iPS cells from healthy donors using CRISPR-Cas9 technology. These iMacs that carry disease-related mutations can be used to study the aetiology of the particular disease in vitro. To achieve more physiological relevance, iMacs can be co-cultured in 2D systems with iPS cell-derived cells or in 3D systems with iPS cell-derived organoids. Here, we discuss the studies that have attempted to model various human diseases using iMacs, highlighting how these have advanced our knowledge about the role of macrophages in health and disease.","Satish Kumar Tiwari, Wei Jie Wong, Marco Moreira, Claudia Pasqualini, Florent Ginhoux",Nature reviews.

39329019,The role of ubiquitination in health and disease.,"Ubiquitination is an enzymatic process characterized by the covalent attachment of ubiquitin to target proteins, thereby modulating their degradation, transportation, and signal transduction. By precisely regulating protein quality and quantity, ubiquitination is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis, DNA repair, cell cycle regulation, and immune responses. Nevertheless, the diversity of ubiquitin enzymes and their extensive involvement in numerous biological processes contribute to the complexity and variety of diseases resulting from their dysregulation. The ubiquitination process relies on a sophisticated enzymatic system, ubiquitin domains, and ubiquitin receptors, which collectively impart versatility to the ubiquitination pathway. The widespread presence of ubiquitin highlights its potential to induce pathological conditions. Ubiquitinated proteins are predominantly degraded through the proteasomal system, which also plays a key role in regulating protein localization and transport, as well as involvement in inflammatory pathways. This review systematically delineates the roles of ubiquitination in maintaining protein homeostasis, DNA repair, genomic stability, cell cycle regulation, cellular proliferation, and immune and inflammatory responses. Furthermore, the mechanisms by which ubiquitination is implicated in various pathologies, alongside current modulators of ubiquitination are discussed. Enhancing our comprehension of ubiquitination aims to provide novel insights into diseases involving ubiquitination and to propose innovative therapeutic strategies for clinical conditions.","Yan Liao, Wangzheqi Zhang, Yang Liu, Chenglong Zhu, Zui Zou",MedComm,2024,protein degradation; protein homeostasis; ubiquitin; ubiquitination,10.1002/mco2.736,Faculty of Anesthesiology Changhai Hospital Naval Medical University Shanghai China.; Faculty of Anesthesiology Changhai Hospital Naval Medical University Shanghai China.; Faculty of Anesthesiology Changhai Hospital Naval Medical University Shanghai China.; Faculty of Anesthesiology Changhai Hospital Naval Medical University Shanghai China.; Faculty of Anesthesiology Changhai Hospital Naval Medical University Shanghai China.,N/A,N/A,Journal Article; Review

39324363,"Septins: Structural Insights, Functional Dynamics, and Implications in Health and Disease.","Septins are a class of proteins with diverse and vital roles in cell biology. Structurally, they form hetero-oligomeric complexes and assemble into filaments, contributing to the organization of cells. These filaments act as scaffolds, aiding in processes like membrane remodeling, cytokinesis, and cell motility. Functionally, septins are essential to cell division, playing essential roles in cytokinetic furrow formation and maintaining the structural integrity of the contractile ring. They also regulate membrane trafficking and help organize intracellular organelles. In terms of physiology, septins facilitate cell migration, phagocytosis, and immune responses by maintaining membrane integrity and influencing cytoskeletal dynamics. Septin dysfunction is associated with pathophysiological conditions. Mutations in septin genes have been linked to neurodegenerative diseases, such as hereditary spastic paraplegias, underscoring their significance in neuronal function. Septins also play a role in cancer and infectious diseases, making them potential targets for therapeutic interventions. Septins serve as pivotal components of intracellular signaling networks, engaging with diverse proteins like kinases and phosphatases. By modulating the activity of these molecules, septins regulate vital cellular pathways. This integral role in signaling makes septins central to orchestrating cellular responses to environmental stimuli. This review mainly focuses on the human septins, their structural composition, regulatory functions, and implication in pathophysiological conditions underscores their importance in fundamental cellular biology. Moreover, their potential as therapeutic targets across various diseases further emphasizes their significance.","Aurosikha Das, Ambarish Kunwar",Journal of cellular biochemistry,2024,actin; cytokinesis; cytoskeleton; microtubules; septins,10.1002/jcb.30660,"Department of Biosciences and Bioengineering, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.; Department of Biosciences and Bioengineering, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.",N/A,N/A,Journal Article; Review

39318160,Skin metabolism in obesity: A narrative review.,"Obesity is a complex multifactorial disease in which excess body fat triggers negative health effects. Systemically, obesity causes several changes, such as inflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis; factors linked to the slow and incomplete epithelial regenerative process. Specifically, in the integumentary system, obesity causes an expansion of the skin's surface area and changes in collagen deposition. Molecular underpinnings of why obesity delays wound healing are still poorly understood. In addition to the primary role of dermal adipocytes in lipid storage and heat insulation, they also promote skin immunity, wound healing and hair follicle cycling. As a consequence of the cellular and dysfunctional adaptations of adipocytes, inflammatory immune alterations, alteration in the expression of proteins genes associated with the blood supply, altered collagen formation through fibroblast senescence and excessive degradation of extracellular matrix proteins are metabolic characteristics of the system in obesity that contribute to sustained inflammation and decreased mechanical resistance of the skin.","Rubya Pereira Zaccaron, Carolini Mendes, Camila da Costa, Paulo Cesar Lock Silveira, Gislaine Tezza Rezin",Wound repair and regeneration : official publication of the Wound Healing Society [and] the European Tissue Repair Society,2024,inflammation; obesity; skin; wound healing,10.1111/wrr.13223,"Laboratory of Neurobiology of Inflammatory and Metabolic Processes, Postgraduate Program in Health Sciences, University of Southern Santa Catarina, Tubarão, Santa Catarina, Brazil.; Laboratory of Experimental Pathophysiology, Graduate Program in Health Sciences, Health Sciences Unit, University of Southern Santa Catarina, Criciúma, Santa Catarina, Brazil.; Laboratory of Experimental Pathophysiology, Graduate Program in Health Sciences, Health Sciences Unit, University of Southern Santa Catarina, Criciúma, Santa Catarina, Brazil.; Laboratory of Experimental Pathophysiology, Graduate Program in Health Sciences, Health Sciences Unit, University of Southern Santa Catarina, Criciúma, Santa Catarina, Brazil.; Laboratory of Neurobiology of Inflammatory and Metabolic Processes, Postgraduate Program in Health Sciences, University of Southern Santa Catarina, Tubarão, Santa Catarina, Brazil.",Humans; Obesity; Wound Healing; Skin; Adipocytes; Inflammation; Oxidative Stress,N/A,Journal Article; Review
39317918,"Dysbiosis and fecal microbiota transplant: Contemplating progress in health, neurodegeneration and longevity.","The gut-brain axis plays an important role in mental health. The intestinal epithelial surface is colonized by billions of commensal and transitory bacteria, known as the Gut Microbiota (GM). However, potential pathogens continuously stimulate intestinal immunity when they find the place. The last two decades have witnessed several studies revealing intestinal bacteria as a key factor in the health-disease balance of the gut, as well as disease-emergent in other parts of the body. Various neurological processes, such as cognition, learning, and memory, could be affected by dysbiosis in GM. Additionally, the aging process and longevity are related to systemic inflammation caused by dysbiosis. Commensal GM affects brain development, behavior, and healthy aging suggesting that building changes in GM might be a potential therapeutic method. The innovation in GM dysbiosis is intervention by Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT), which has been confirmed as a therapy for recurrent Clostridium difficile infections and is promising for other clinical disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Alzheimer's disease, and depression. Additionally, FMT may be possible to promote healthy aging, and extend longevity. This review aims to connect dysbiosis, neurological disorders, and aging and the potential of FMT as a therapeutic strategy to treat these disorders, and to enhance the quality of life in the elderly.","Somayeh Ahmadi, Alka Hasani, Aytak Khabbaz, Vahdat Poortahmasbe, Samaneh Hosseini, Mohammad Yasdchi, Elham Mehdizadehfar, Zahra Mousavi, Roqaiyeh Hasani, Edris Nabizadeh, Javad Nezhadi",Biogerontology,2024,Aging; Alzheimer’s disease; Dysbiosis; Fecal microbiota transplantation; Gut microbiota; Neurologic; Parkinson’s disease,10.1007/s10522-024-10136-4,"Infectious and Tropical Diseases Research Center, Faculty of Medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.; Infectious and Tropical Diseases Research Center, Faculty of Medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran. dr.alkahasani@gmail.com.; Neurosciences Research Center, Faculty of Medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.; Infectious and Tropical Diseases Research Center, Faculty of Medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.; Neurosciences Research Center, Faculty of Medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.; Neurosciences Research Center, Faculty of Medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.; Neurosciences Research Center, Faculty of Medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.; Department of Psychology, Faculty of Medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.; School of Medicine, Istanbul Okan University, Tuzla, 34959, Istanbul, Turkey.; Infectious and Tropical Diseases Research Center, Faculty of Medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.; Infectious and Tropical Diseases Research Center, Faculty of Medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.",Humans; Dysbiosis; Fecal Microbiota Transplantation; Longevity; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Animals; Aging; Brain-Gut Axis,N/A,Journal Article; Review

The quality of life of patients with this disease is severely compromised, especially in moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. Secukinumab, a fully humanized monoclonal antibody, was the first anti-interleukin (IL)-17 biologic approved for treating psoriasis. Secukinumab demonstrated long-lasting efficacy and a good safety profile in individuals with plaque psoriasis, and it is associated with an improvement in health-related quality of life. While there is evidence that early treatment with systemic therapy can affect disease progression and improve long-term outcomes in other autoimmune diseases, evidence is limited in psoriasis, especially in real-world settings. This review provides an overview of studies describing the effectiveness of secukinumab in the treatment of psoriasis summarizing the literature and focusing on real-world evidence and early intervention.","Piergiorgio Malagoli, Paolo Dapavo, Paolo Amerio, Laura Atzori, Anna Balato, Federico Bardazzi, Luca Bianchi, Angelo Cattaneo, Andrea Chiricozzi, Maurizio Congedo, Maria Concetta Fargnoli, Claudia Giofrè, Paolo Gisondi, Claudio Guarneri, Serena Lembo, Francesco Loconsole, Giampiero Mazzocchetti, Santo Raffaele Mercuri, Pietro Morrone, Anna Maria Offidani, Giovanni Palazzo, Aurora Parodi, Giovanni Pellacani, Stefano Piaserico, Concetta Potenza, Francesca Prignano, Marco Romanelli, Paola Savoia, Luca Stingeni, Massimo Travaglini, Emanuele Trovato, Marina Venturini, Leonardo Zichichi, Antonio Costanzo",Dermatology and therapy,2024,Early treatment; Psoriasis; Secukinumab; Treatment,10.1007/s13555-024-01255-4,"Psocare Unit, IRCCS Policlinico San Donato, 20097, San Donato Milanese (Milan), Italy.; Clinica Dermatologica Universitaria di Torino, ASO Città della Salute e della Scienza, 10126, Turin, Italy.; Dermatology Unit, UOC Dermatologia, Università G.d'Annunzio, 66100, Chieti-Pescara, Italy.; Dermatology Unit, Department Medical Sciences and Public Health, University of Cagliari, 09124, Cagliari, Italy.; Dermatology Unit, University of Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, 81055, Naples, Italy.; Dermatology Unit, IRCCS Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Bologna, 40138, Bologna, Italy.; Dermatology Unit, Fondazione Policlinico Tor Vergata, 00133, Rome, Italy.; Fondazione IRCCS Cà Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, 20122, Milan, Italy.; Dermatology Unit, Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A.

Cardiotoxic effects have been shown to result from oral 2-MCPD exposure in rodents, but the underlying mechanisms of action remain poorly understood. We undertook a comprehensive multi-omics approach to assess changes at the transcriptomic, proteomic, and oxylipin levels in heart tissues from male F344 rats that were exposed to 0 or 40 mg/kg BW/day of 2-MCPD in the diet for 90 days, in a regulatory compliant rodent bioassay. Heart tissues were collected for RNA sequencing, quantitative PCR analysis, proteomic analysis via two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry, and targeted lipidomic profiling by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). Transcriptomic and proteomic data analyses revealed upregulation of immune/inflammatory response processes and downregulation of energy metabolism and cardiac structure and functions. Among differentially expressed gene-protein pairs, coronin-1A, a key leukocyte-regulating protein, emerged as markedly up-regulated. Oxylipin profiling highlighted a selective suppression of docosahexaenoic acid-derived metabolites, suggesting a disruption in cardioprotective lipid pathways. These findings suggest that 2-MCPD disrupts homeostasis through inflammatory activation and suppression of metabolic and cardiac function. This research provides insights into 2-MCPD's cardiotoxicity, emphasizing the need for further studies to support hazard characterization.","Lucien G J Cayer, Thorsten Buhrke, Jennifer Roberts, Andrée Nunnikhoven, Katharina Sommerkorn, Anna Reinhold, Albert Braeuning, Jayadev Raju, Harold M Aukema, Tobias Karakach",Archives of toxicology,2024,2-MCPD; Cardiotoxicity; Multi-omics; Oxylipin; Proteome; Transcriptome,10.1007/s00204-024-03856-6,"Food and Human Nutritional Sciences, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada.; Department of Food Safety, German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment, Berlin, Germany.; Health Canada, Bureau of Chemical Safety, Ottawa, Canada.; Health Canada, Bureau of Chemical Safety, Ottawa, Canada.; Department of Food Safety, German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment, Berlin, Germany.; Department of Food Safety, German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment, Berlin, Germany.; Department of Food Safety, German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment, Berlin, Germany.; Food and Human Nutritional Sciences, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada. jayadev.raju@hc-sc.gc.ca.; Food and Human Nutritional Sciences, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada.; Food and Human Nutritional Sciences, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada.","Animals; Male; Rats, Inbred F344; alpha-Chlorohydrin; Proteomics; Myocardium; Rats; Food Contamination; Transcriptome; Oxylipins; Cardiotoxicity; Lipidomics; Heart; Tandem Mass Spectrometry; Multiomics",RGPIN 6215 (National Sciences and Engineering Research Council),Journal Article

39311537,The effects of stress on gut virome: Implications on infectious disease and systemic disorders.,"The role of gut microbiota in health and disease is being thoroughly examined in various contexts, with a specific focus on the bacterial fraction due to its significant abundance. However, despite their lower abundance, viruses within the gut microbiota are gaining recognition for their crucial role in shaping the structure and function of the intestinal microbiota, with significant effects on the host as a whole, particularly the immune system. Similarly, environmental factors such as stress are key in modulating the host immune system, which in turn influences the composition of the gut virome and neurological functions through the bidirectional communication of the gut-brain axis. In this context, alterations in the host immune system due to stress and/or dysbiosis of the gut virome are critical factors in the development of both infectious and noninfectious diseases. The molecular mechanisms and correlation patterns between microbial species are not yet fully understood. This literature review seeks to explore the interconnected relationship between stress and the gut virome, with a focus on how this interaction is influenced by the host's immune system.

39308210,Innate immunity champions: The diverse functions of macrophages.,"Macrophages are instrumental in maintaining tissue homeostasis, modulating inflammation, and driving regeneration. The advent of omics techniques has led to the identification of numerous tissue-specific macrophage subtypes, thereby introducing the concept of the ""macrophage niche"". This paradigm underscores the ability of macrophages to adapt their functions based on environmental cues, such as tissue-specific signals. This adaptability is closely linked to their metabolic states, which are crucial for their function and role in health and disease. Macrophage metabolism is central to their ability to switch between proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory states. In this regard, environmental factors, including the extracellular matrix, cellular interactions, and microbial metabolites, profoundly influence macrophage behavior. Moreover, diet and gut microbiota significantly impact macrophage function, with nutrients and microbial metabolites influencing their activity and contributing to conditions like inflammatory bowel disease. Targeting specific macrophage functions and their metabolic processes is leading to the development of novel treatments for a range of chronic inflammatory conditions. The exploration of macrophage biology enriches our understanding of immune regulation and holds the promise of innovative approaches to managing diseases marked by inflammation and immune dysfunction, offering a frontier for scientific and clinical advancement.","Francesca Biscu, Anissa Zouzaf, Donatella Cicia, Clare Pridans, Gianluca Matteoli",European journal of immunology,2024,Chronic diseases; Inflammation; Macrophages; Metabolism; Therapies,10.1002/eji.202451139,"Laboratory of Mucosal Immunology, Department of Chronic Diseases, Metabolism, and Ageing (CHROMETA), Translational Research Center for Gastrointestinal Disorders (TARGID), KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.; Laboratory of Mucosal Immunology, Department of Chronic Diseases, Metabolism, and Ageing (CHROMETA), Translational Research Center for Gastrointestinal Disorders (TARGID), KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.; Laboratory of Mucosal Immunology, Department of Chronic Diseases, Metabolism, and Ageing (CHROMETA), Translational Research Center for Gastrointestinal Disorders (TARGID), KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.; Centre for Inflammation Research, Institute for Regeneration and Repair, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.; Laboratory of Mucosal Immunology, Department of Chronic Diseases, Metabolism, and Ageing (CHROMETA), Translational Research Center for Gastrointestinal Disorders (TARGID), KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.",N/A,GPUE/20/003 (KU LEUVEN INTERNAL FUNDS KU Leuven Global PhD Partnerships with the University of Edinburgh); FWO 1SF4722N (Fonds voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek Vlaanderen); G0D8317N (FWO); G0A7919N (FWO); G086721N (FWO); G088816N (FWO); S008419N (FWO); C12/15/016C14/17/097 (KU Leuven Internal Funds),Journal Article; Review

The objective of this study was to evaluate predictors of vaccination coverage in Brazil for the first year of life between 2013 and 2022. We focused on variables pertaining to the available resources of local governments and their investments in infrastructure and human resources in the health sector. We used binomial generalized linear mixed models to estimate the association of these variables with vaccination coverage in Brazilian municipalities. Our results show that municipalities with better fiscal capacity were more effective in delivering vaccines. Municipalities that rely more on federal and state resources had lower vaccination coverage. Additionally, investment in health professionals was often negatively correlated with vaccination coverage. The study underscores the importance of better understanding the relationship between local government characteristics and vaccination coverage, particularly in regions where local governments are responsible for vaccine delivery.","Lizandro Lui, Weeberb J Réquia, Fernanda Dos Santos, Carlas Estefania Albert, Luan da Cruz Vieira, Sean McGrath",Vaccine,2024,Fiscal capacity; Health professionals; Local governments; Resource dependency; Vaccination coverage,10.1016/j.vaccine.2024.126382,"School of Public Policy and Government, Fundação Getúlio Vargas, Brasília, Brazil.

39302484,Effect of Staphylococcus aureus colonization and immune defects on the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis.,"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common and recurrent skin disease characterized by skin barrier dysfunction, inflammation and chronic pruritus, with wide heterogeneity in terms of age of onset, clinical course and persistence over the lifespan. Although the pathogenesis of the disease are unclear, epidermal barrier dysfunction, immune and microbial dysregulation, and environmental factors are known to be critical etiologies in AD pathology. The skin microbiota represents an ecosystem consisting of numerous microbial species that interact with each other as well as host epithelial cells and immune cells. Although the skin microbiota benefits the host by supporting the basic functions of the skin and preventing the colonization of pathogens, disruption of the microbial balance (dysbiosis) can cause skin diseases such as AD. Although AD is a dermatological disease, recent evidence has shown that changes in microbiota composition in the skin and intestine contribute to the pathogenesis of AD. Environmental factors that contribute to skin barrier dysfunction and microbial dysbiosis in AD include allergens, diet, irritants, air pollution, epigenetics and microbial exposure. Knowing the microbial combination of intestin, as well as the genetic and epigenetic determinants associated with the development of autoantibodies, may help elucidate the pathophysiology of the disease. The skin of patients with AD is characterized by microbial dysbiosis as a result of reduced microbial diversity and overgrowth of the pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus. Recent studies have revealed the importance of building a strong immune response against microorganisms during childhood and new mechanisms of microbial community dynamics in modulating the skin microbiome. Numerous microorganisms are reported to modulate host response through communication with keratinocytes, specific immune cells and adipocytes to improve skin health and barrier function. This growing insight into bioactive substances in the skin microbiota has led to novel biotherapeutic approaches targeting the skin surface for the treatment of AD. This review will provide an updated overview of the skin microbiota in AD and its complex interaction with immune response mechanisms, as well as explore possible underlying mechanisms in the pathogenesis of AD and provide insights into new therapeutic developments for the treatment of AD. It also focuses on restoring skin microbial homeostasis, aiming to reduce inflammation by repairing the skin barrier.","Evrim Özdemіr, Lütfiye Öksüz",Archives of microbiology,2024,Staphylococcus aureus; Atopic dermatitis; Immune defects; Skin microbiota,10.1007/s00203-024-04134-w,"Department of Medical Microbiology, Istanbul Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey. evrimozdemir2020@ogr.iu.edu.tr.; Department of Medical Microbiology, Istanbul Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey.","Dermatitis, Atopic; Humans; Staphylococcus aureus; Skin; Dysbiosis; Microbiota; Animals; Staphylococcal Infections",N/A,Journal Article; Review
39300122,"Pyroptosis in health and disease: mechanisms, regulation and clinical perspective.","Pyroptosis is a type of programmed cell death characterized by cell swelling and osmotic lysis, resulting in cytomembrane rupture and release of immunostimulatory components, which play a role in several pathological processes. Significant cellular responses to various stimuli involve the formation of inflammasomes, maturation of inflammatory caspases, and caspase-mediated cleavage of gasdermin. The function of pyroptosis in disease is complex but not a simple angelic or demonic role. While inflammatory diseases such as sepsis are associated with uncontrollable pyroptosis, the potent immune response induced by pyroptosis can be exploited as a therapeutic target for anti-tumor therapy. Thus, a comprehensive review of the role of pyroptosis in disease is crucial for further research and clinical translation from bench to bedside. In this review, we summarize the recent advancements in understanding the role of pyroptosis in disease, covering the related development history, molecular mechanisms including canonical, non-canonical, caspase 3/8, and granzyme-mediated pathways, and its regulatory function in health and multiple diseases. Moreover, this review also provides updates on promising therapeutic strategies by applying novel small molecule inhibitors and traditional medicines to regulate pyroptosis. The present dilemmas and future directions in the landscape of pyroptosis are also discussed from a clinical perspective, providing clues for scientists to develop novel drugs targeting pyroptosis.","Yifan Liu, Renjie Pan, Yuzhen Ouyang, Wangning Gu, Tengfei Xiao, Hongmin Yang, Ling Tang, Hui Wang, Bo Xiang, Pan Chen",Signal transduction and targeted therapy,2024,N/A,10.1038/s41392-024-01958-2,"The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Xiangya School of Medicine, Central South University/Hunan Cancer Hospital, Changsha, 410013, China.; The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Xiangya School of Medicine, Central South University/Hunan Cancer Hospital, Changsha, 410013, China.; The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Xiangya School of Medicine, Central South University/Hunan Cancer Hospital, Changsha, 410013, China.; The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Xiangya School of Medicine, Central South University/Hunan Cancer Hospital, Changsha, 410013, China.; The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Xiangya School of Medicine, Central South University/Hunan Cancer Hospital, Changsha, 410013, China.; The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Xiangya School of Medicine, Central South University/Hunan Cancer Hospital, Changsha, 410013, China.; The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Xiangya School of Medicine, Central South University/Hunan Cancer Hospital, Changsha, 410013, China.; The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Xiangya School of Medicine, Central South University/Hunan Cancer Hospital, Changsha, 410013, China. wanghui@hnca.org.cn.; The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Xiangya School of Medicine, Central South University/Hunan Cancer Hospital, Changsha, 410013, China. xiangbolin@csu.edu.cn.; The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Xiangya School of Medicine, Central South University/Hunan Cancer Hospital, Changsha, 410013, China. chenpan08@csu.edu.cn.",Pyroptosis; Humans; Inflammasomes; Granzymes; Sepsis; Caspase 8; Neoplasms; Signal Transduction,R01 DK002001 (NIDDK NIH HHS); R56 DK002001 (NIDDK NIH HHS); 82173201 (National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science Foundation of China)); 82272758 (National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science Foundation of China)); U23A20456 (National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science Foundation of China)),Journal Article; Review

In ischemic stroke, several processes combine to produce immunosuppression, leaving the post-stroke body susceptible to infection, which in turn affects neuroinflammation. Interleukin-33 (IL-33), a member of the interleukin-1 family (IL-1), functions as a modulator of immune responses and inflammation, playing a crucial role in the establishment of immunologic responses. IL-33 has been shown to have a protective effect on brain injury and represents a potential target by modulating inflammatory cytokines and stimulating immune regulatory cells.

39293524,HMGA1 stimulates cancer stem-like features and sensitivity to monensin in gastric cancer.,"Gastric cancer represents a serious health problem worldwide, with insufficient molecular biomarkers and therapeutic options. Consequently, several efforts have been directed towards finding specific disease markers in order to develop new therapies capable of defeating gastric cancer. Attention has been pointed to cancer stem cells (CSCs) as they are primarily responsible for tumor initiation and recurrence, making them essential therapeutic targets. Using the SORE6-GFP reporter system, based on the expression of SOX2 and/or OCT4 to drive GFP expression, we isolated gastric cancer stem-like cells (SORE6+ cells) enriched in several molecules, including SOX2, C-MYC, KLF4, HIF-1α, NOTCH1 and HMGA1. Here, we explored the previously undisclosed link of HMGA1 with gastric CSCs. Our results indicated that HMGA1 can activate a transcriptional program that includes SOX2, C-MYC, and KLF4 and endows cells with CSC features. We further showed that chemical induction of gastric CSCs using ciclopirox (CPX) can be mediated by HMGA1. Finally, we showed that HMGA1 GFP+ cells were sensitive to monensin confirming the selective activity of this drug over CSCs. Thus, HMGA1 is a key player in the cellular reprogramming of gastric non-CSCs to cancer stem-like cells.","Diana Pádua, Paula Figueira, António Pombinho, Inês Monteiro, Carlos Filipe Pereira, Raquel Almeida, Patrícia Mesquita",Experimental cell research,2024,Cellular reprogramming; Drug resistance; Monensin; SOX2; Transcription factors,10.1016/j.yexcr.2024.114257,"i3S-Institute for Research and Innovation in Health, University of Porto, 4200-135, Porto, Portugal; IPATIMUP-Institute of Molecular Pathology and Immunology, University of Porto, 4200-465, Porto, Portugal; ICBAS-School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, University of Porto, 4050-313, Porto, Portugal.; i3S-Institute for Research and Innovation in Health, University of Porto, 4200-135, Porto, Portugal; IPATIMUP-Institute of Molecular Pathology and Immunology, University of Porto, 4200-465, Porto, Portugal.; i3S-Institute for Research and Innovation in Health, University of Porto, 4200-135, Porto, Portugal; IBMC-Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of Porto, 4200-135, Porto, Portugal.; i3S-Institute for Research and Innovation in Health, University of Porto, 4200-135, Porto, Portugal; IPATIMUP-Institute of Molecular Pathology and Immunology, University of Porto, 4200-465, Porto, Portugal.; CNC-Center for Neuroscience and Cell Biology, University of Coimbra, 3004-517, Coimbra, Portugal; Cell Reprogramming in Hematopoiesis and Immunity Laboratory, Molecular Medicine and Gene Therapy, Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund University, BMC A12, 221 84, Lund, Sweden; Wallenberg Center for Molecular Medicine, Lund University, 221 84, Lund, Sweden.; i3S-Institute for Research and Innovation in Health, University of Porto, 4200-135, Porto, Portugal; IPATIMUP-Institute of Molecular Pathology and Immunology, University of Porto, 4200-465, Porto, Portugal.; i3S-Institute for Research and Innovation in Health, University of Porto, 4200-135, Porto, Portugal; IPATIMUP-Institute of Molecular Pathology and Immunology, University of Porto, 4200-465, Porto, Portugal.

39282183,Role of Gut Microbiome in Cancer Treatment.,"The gut microbiota influences the effectiveness and side effects of cancer treatments, particularly immunotherapy and associated immune-related complications. This important involvement of the microbiome is supported by the patients receiving antibiotics responding poorly to immunotherapy. Relatively few research has examined the underlying processes, and until recently, data regarding the detection of the microbial organisms that trigger these effects were inconsistent. Since then, a deeper comprehension of the processes of action and taxonomic classification of the relevant species has been attained. It's been demonstrated that certain bacterial species can enhance the body's reaction to immune checkpoint inhibitors through the release of distinct metabolites or products. Nonetheless, in certain patients who are not responding, Gram-negative bacteria may have a dominating suppressive impact. Patients' propensity to react to immunotherapy can be somewhat accurately predicted by machine learning techniques based on their microbiome makeup. Consequently, there has been an increase in interest in modifying the microbiome makeup to enhance patient reaction to medication. Clinical proof-of-concept studies demonstrate that dietary modifications or fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) might be used therapeutically to increase the efficacy of immunotherapy in cancer patients. Current developments and new approaches for microbiota-based cancer treatments have been emphasized. In conclusion, preclinical research on animals and human clinical trials has made tremendous progress in our understanding of the function of the gut microbiome in health and illness. These investigations have shed light on the effects of food, FMT, probiotics, prebiotics, and microbiome-disease connections. However, there are still a lot of issues and restrictions that must be resolved before this research can be used in real-world clinical settings.","Vijay Mishra, Yachana Mishra",Indian journal of microbiology,2024,Cancer treatment; Gut microbiota; Immune-checkpoint inhibitors; Immunotherapy; Microbiome,10.1007/s12088-024-01340-4,"School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Lovely Professional University, Phagwara, Punjab 144411 India.; School of Bioengineering and Biosciences, Lovely Professional University, Phagwara, Punjab 144411 India.",N/A,N/A,Journal Article

We utilized a sex-stratified phenomic environment-wide association study (PheEWAS), which allowed the identification of associations across a wide range of phenotypes and environmental exposures. We examined associations between 272 environmental exposures, including smoking-related exposures such as cotinine levels and smoking habits, and 58 clinically relevant blood phenotypes, such as serum albumin and homocysteine levels. Our analysis identified 119 sex-specific associations. For example, smoking-related exposures had a stronger impact on increasing homocysteine, hemoglobin, and hematocrit levels in females while reducing serum albumin and bilirubin levels and increasing c-reactive protein levels more significantly in males. These findings suggest mechanisms by which smoking exposure may pose higher cardiovascular risks and greater induced hypoxia for women, and greater inflammatory and immune responses in men. The results highlight the importance of considering sex differences in biomedical research. Understanding these differences can help develop more personalized and effective health interventions and improve clinical outcomes for both men and women.","Tomás González Zarzar, Nicole E Palmiero, Dokyoon Kim, Li Shen, Molly A Hall",Scientific reports,2024,Albumin; CVD; Environmental exposures; Homocysteine; Inflammation; PheEWAS; Red blood cell; Smoking exposure,10.1038/s41598-024-72180-x,"School of Medicine, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Santiago, Chile. tgonza@uc.cl.; Institute for Biomedical Informatics, Department of Genetics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA.; Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA.; Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA.; Institute for Biomedical Informatics, Department of Genetics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA.",Humans; Female; Male; Environmental Exposure; Middle Aged; Adult; Sex Factors; Smoking; Nutrition Surveys; Phenotype; Sex Characteristics; Cotinine,N/A,Journal Article
39270403,Availability and financing of CAR-T cell therapies: A cross-country comparative analysis.,"Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapies (CAR-T therapies) are a type of advanced therapy medicinal product (ATMP) that belong to a new generation of personalised cancer immunotherapies. This paper compares the approval, availability and financing of CAR-T cell therapies in ten countries. It also examines the implementation of this type of ATMP within the health care system, describing the organizational elements of CAR-T therapy delivery and the challenges of ensuring equitable access to all those in need, taking a more systems-oriented view. It finds that the availability of CAR-T therapies varies across countries, reflecting the heterogeneity in the organization and financing of specialised care, particularly oncology care. Countries have been cautious in designing reimbursement models for CAR-T cell therapies, establishing limited managed entry arrangements under public payers, either based on outcomes or as an evidence development scheme to allow for the study of real-world therapeutic efficacy. The delivery model of CAR-T therapies is concentrated around existing experienced cancer centres and highlights the need for high networking and referral capacity. Some countries have transparent and systematic eligibility criteria to help ensure more equitable access to therapies. Overall, as with other pharmaceuticals, there is limited transparency in pricing, eligibility criteria and budgeting decisions in this therapeutic area.","Yulia Litvinova, Sherry Merkur, Sara Allin, Ester Angulo-Pueyo, Daiga Behmane, Enrique Bernal-Delgado, Miriam Dalmas, Antonio De Belvis, Nigel Edwards, Francisco Estupiñán-Romero, Peter Gaal, Sophie Gerkens, Margaret Jamieson, Alisha Morsella, Dario Picecchi, Hilde Røshol, Ingrid Sperre Saunes, Terry Sullivan, Balázs Szécsényi-Nagy, Inneke Van De Vijver, Ricciardi Walter, Dimitra Panteli","Health policy (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2024,"Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products (ATMPs); Cancer, Pharmaceutical policy; Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies; Oncology care",10.1016/j.healthpol.2024.105153,"Department of Health Care Management, Berlin University of Technology, Str. des 17.

39266465,Leveraging current insights on IL-10-producing dendritic cells for developing effective immunotherapeutic approaches.,"Dendritic cells (DC) are professional antigen-presenting cells involved in promoting and controlling immune responses. Different subsets of DC, named tolerogenic (tol)DC, play a critical role in the maintenance of tissue homeostasis and in fostering tolerance. These unique skills make tolDC especially attractive for strategies aimed at re-establishing/inducing tolerance in immune-mediated conditions. The generation of potent tolDC in vitro from peripheral blood monocytes has seen remarkable advancements. TolDC modulate T cell dynamics by favoring regulatory T cells (Tregs) and curbing effector/pathogenic T cells. Among the several methods developed for in vitro tolDC generation, IL-10 conditioning has been proven to be the most efficient, as IL-10-modulated tolDC were demonstrated to promote Tregs with the strongest suppressive activities. Investigating the molecular, metabolic, and functional profiles of tolDC uncovers essential pathways that facilitate their immunoregulatory functions. This Review provides an overview of current knowledge on the role of tolDC in health and disease, focusing on IL-10 production, functional characterization of in vitro generated tolDC, molecular and metabolic changes occurring in tolDC induced by tolerogenic agents, clinical applications of tolDC-based therapy, and finally new perspectives in the generation of effective tolDC.","Konstantina Morali, Gloria Giacomello, Michela Vuono, Silvia Gregori",FEBS letters,2024,IL‐10; T regulatory cells; cell metabolism; cell therapy; dendritic cells; tolerance; tolerogenic DC,10.1002/1873-3468.15017,"Mechanisms of Peripheral Tolerance Unit, San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy (SR-Tiget), IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.; Mechanisms of Peripheral Tolerance Unit, San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy (SR-Tiget), IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.; Mechanisms of Peripheral Tolerance Unit, San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy (SR-Tiget), IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.; Mechanisms of Peripheral Tolerance Unit, San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy (SR-Tiget), IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.",N/A,101080562 (Horizon EU 2022 - IMMUTOL),Journal Article; Review

However, no studies assessing intention to vaccinate (ITV) intention toward children of military parents have been documented. The current research aimed to establish the prevalence and factors of ITV children against COVID-19 in military parents in Lambayeque-Peru, 2021. Analysis was conducted with the dependent variable ITV children reported by military parents. The independent variables were history of mental health, searching for mental health support, food insecurity, resilience, anxiety, depression, burnout, posttraumatic stress, and suicidal risk. Prevalence ratios and 95% confidence intervals were estimated. Of 201 military personnel evaluated, 92.5% were male, 82.5% were of the Catholic faith, and the median age was 40.9% of respondents reported seeking mental health help during the COVID-19 pandemic. It was reported anxiety (20.3%), depression (6.5%), and posttraumatic stress disorder (6.5%). Most reported ITV in children against COVID-19 (93%). In the multiple models, we found that Catholics had a 23% higher prevalence of ITV in the children where PR = prevalence ratios and CI = confidence intervals (PR = 1.23; 95% CI: 1.01-1.50). Likewise, seeking mental health support increased the prevalence of ITV by 8% (PR = 1.08; 95% CI: 1.00-1.15). Seeking mental health support and belonging to the Catholic faith had a higher ITV of children of Peruvian military personnel.

39260934,Chemokine receptors in primary and secondary lymphoid tissues.,"Chemokine receptors are a complex superfamily of surface G protein-coupled receptors present mostly in leukocytes. In this chapter, we review the presence and functions of chemokine receptors in the immune cells of the primary and secondary lymphoid organs. Those include bone marrow, thymus, spleen, lymph nodes, and Peyer's patches as the main components of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue. There are general groups of chemokine receptors: conventional and atypical. We will mostly cover the role of conventional chemokine receptors, which are divided into four classes (CC, CXC, CX3C, and XC). Some relevant members are CXCR4, CXCR5, CCR4 and CCR7. For example, CXCR4 is a key chemokine receptor in the bone marrow controlling from the homing of progenitor cells into the bone marrow, the development of B cells, to the homing of long-lived plasma cells to this primary lymphoid organ. CCR7 and CCR4 are two of the main players in the thymus. CCR7 along with CCR9 control the traffic of thymic seed progenitors into the thymus, while CCR4 and CCR7 are critical for the entry of thymocytes into the medulla and as controllers of the central tolerance in the thymus. CXCR4 and CXCR5 have major roles in the spleen, guiding the maturation and class-switching of B cells in the different areas of the germinal center. In the T-cell zone, CCR7 guides the differentiation of naïve T cells. CCR7 also controls and directs the entry of T cells, B cells, and dendritic cells into secondary lymphoid tissues, including the spleen and lymph nodes. As new technologies emerge, techniques such as high dimensional spectral flow cytometry or single-cell sequencing allow a more comprehensive knowledge of the chemokine receptor network and their ligands, as well as the discovery of new interactions mediating unknown and overlooked mechanisms in health and disease.",Hector Cordero,International review of cell and molecular biology,2024,Chemokine receptors; Immune cells; Immunity; Lymphoid tissue; Plasma cells; Thymus,10.1016/bs.ircmb.2023.11.003,"Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States; Immunology Group, Department of Physiology, Faculty of Veterinary, University of Extremadura, 10003 Caceres, Spain.

This article presents the Epidemiological Intelligence Center (CIE) and the tools and products developed in its coordination. The CIE was inaugurated in March 2022, with a multiprofessional team, supported by the premises of transparency and integration of various data sources for early detection of changes in the trends of events of importance in Public Health. The initial acquisition of a data lake favored changes in the consumption, management and security processes for the data processed. This data lake currently stores the Carioca Base - a retrospective cohort of individuals with a history of COVID-19 vaccination and/or events related to the disease. Descriptive and analytical dashboards have been developed and made available, respectively for public use and for health surveillance administrators. An alert panel, aimed at monitoring trends in care in the urgency and emergency network, was implemented and subsidizes rapid response actions in the city's territories. The CIE developed the concept of epidemiological intelligence in the Brazilian Unified National Health System and this paradigm shift was made possible by investments in physical/human resources, the integration of epidemiological, statistical and data science methods, as well as the incorporation of different data sources in data analysis.","Débora Medeiros de Oliveira E Cruz, Caroline Dias Ferreira, Luciana Freire de Carvalho, Valéria Saraceni, Betina Durovni, Oswaldo Gonçalves Cruz, Marcio Henrique de Oliveira Garcia, Gislani Mateus Oliveira Aguilar",Cadernos de saude publica,2024,N/A,10.1590/0102-311XPT160523,"Secretaria Municipal de Saúde do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brasil.; Secretaria Municipal de Saúde do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brasil.; Secretaria Municipal de Saúde do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brasil.; Secretaria Municipal de Saúde do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brasil.; Secretaria Municipal de Saúde do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brasil.; Programa de Computação Científica, Fundação Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brasil.; Ministério da Saúde, Brasília, Brasil.; Secretaria Municipal de Saúde do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brasil.",Humans; Brazil; COVID-19; Information Technology; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Population Surveillance,N/A,English Abstract; Journal Article

This is particularly true of diseases of the heart-lung axis, given the tight anatomical connections of the two organs within a common cavity in which they collectively orchestrate the two major, intertwined circulatory pathways. Immune cells and the soluble mediators they secrete serve as effective, and targetable, messengers of signals between different regions of the body but can also contribute to the spread of pathology. In this review, we discuss the immunological basis of interorgan communication between the heart and lung in various common diseases, and in the context of organ crosstalk more generally. Gaining a greater understanding of how the heart and lung communicate in health and disease, and viewing disease progression generally from a more holistic, whole-body viewpoint have the potential to inform new diagnostic approaches and strategies for better prevention and treatment of comorbidities.","Jonathan L Gillan, Lara Jaeschke, Wolfgang M Kuebler, Jana Grune",Pflugers Archiv : European journal of physiology,2024,Cardiopulmonary axis; Heart–lung immunology; Interorgan communication; Organ crosstalk; Pulmonary hypertension,10.1007/s00424-024-03013-z,"Department of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Surgery, Deutsches Herzzentrum Der Charité (DHZC), Virchowweg 6, 10117, Berlin, Germany.; Department of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Surgery, Deutsches Herzzentrum Der Charité (DHZC), Virchowweg 6, 10117, Berlin, Germany.; Department of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Surgery, Deutsches Herzzentrum Der Charité (DHZC), Virchowweg 6, 10117, Berlin, Germany.; Department of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Surgery, Deutsches Herzzentrum Der Charité (DHZC), Virchowweg 6, 10117, Berlin, Germany.

To achieve the concept of justice in health and sustainable development, it is imperative to improve the health status of all citizens in Iran, which consists of the nomadic communities, and urban and rural populations. In this ecological study national health indexes in nomadic tribespeople was Identified and prioritized by expert panel and fuzzy Delphi method. In the first step, the national health indexes were extracted from the literature, and then indexes that can be measured, evaluated and representative of the nomadic communities were extracted and prioritized by using fuzzy Delphi and TOPSIS methods, Questionnaire options were analyzed according to 3 criteria of economic efficiency, measurability, and simplicity in the form of 13 components and their indicators. The analysis of the results of the fuzzy Delphi method shows that the mental health component has the lowest real score in the criteria of measurability, simplicity and economic efficiency. The child care component has the highest real score in terms of economic efficiency and the vaccination component has the highest real score based on the criteria of measurability and simplicity in nomadic communities.

Strong evidence points to a role for TNTs in the intercellular transfer of signals, molecules, organelles, and pathogens, involving them in many cellular functions. In myeloid cells (e.g., monocytes/macrophages, dendritic cells, and osteoclasts), intercellular communication via TNT contributes to their differentiation and immune functions, by favoring material and pathogen transfer, as well as cell fusion.

39241776,Profiling migration of human monocytes in response to chemotactic and barotactic guidance cues.,"Monocytes are critical to innate immunity, participating in chemotaxis during tissue injury, infection, and inflammatory conditions. However, the migration dynamics of human monocytes under different guidance cues are not well characterized. Here, we developed a microfluidic device to profile the migration characteristics of human monocytes under chemotactic and barotactic guidance cues while also assessing the effects of age and cytokine stimulation. Human monocytes preferentially migrated toward the CCL2 gradient through confined microchannels, regardless of donor age and migration pathway. Stimulation with interferon (IFN)-γ, but not granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), disrupted monocyte navigation through complex paths and decreased monocyte CCL2 chemotaxis, velocity, and CCR2 expression. Additionally, monocytes exhibited a bias toward low-hydraulic-resistance pathways in asymmetric environments, which remained consistent across donor ages, cytokine stimulation, and chemoattractants. This microfluidic system provides insights into the unique migratory behaviors of human monocytes and is a valuable tool for studying peripheral immune cell migration in health and disease.","Clare K Hall, Olivia M Barr, Antoine Delamare, Alex Burkholder, Alice Tsai, Yuyao Tian, Felix E Ellett, Brent M Li, Rudolph E Tanzi, Mehdi Jorfi",Cell reports methods,2024,CP: Biotechnology; CP: Immunology; cell migration; chemotaxis; microfluidic; monocytes; peripheral immune cells,10.1016/j.crmeth.2024.100846,"Genetics and Aging Research Unit, McCance Center for Brain Health, Mass General Institute for Neurodegenerative Disease, Department of Neurology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Charlestown, MA, USA.; Genetics and Aging Research Unit, McCance Center for Brain Health, Mass General Institute for Neurodegenerative Disease, Department of Neurology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Charlestown, MA, USA.; Genetics and Aging Research Unit, McCance Center for Brain Health, Mass General Institute for Neurodegenerative Disease, Department of Neurology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Charlestown, MA, USA.; Genetics and Aging Research Unit, McCance Center for Brain Health, Mass General Institute for Neurodegenerative Disease, Department of Neurology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Charlestown, MA, USA.; Genetics and Aging Research Unit, McCance Center for Brain Health, Mass General Institute for Neurodegenerative Disease, Department of Neurology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Charlestown, MA, USA.; Genetics and Aging Research Unit, McCance Center for Brain Health, Mass General Institute for Neurodegenerative Disease, Department of Neurology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Charlestown, MA, USA.; Center for Engineering in Medicine and Surgery, Massachusetts General Hospital, Charlestown, MA, USA; Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Genetics and Aging Research Unit, McCance Center for Brain Health, Mass General Institute for Neurodegenerative Disease, Department of Neurology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Charlestown, MA, USA.; Genetics and Aging Research Unit, McCance Center for Brain Health, Mass General Institute for Neurodegenerative Disease, Department of Neurology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Charlestown, MA, USA; Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.

39241519,Could P2X7 receptor be a potencial target in neonatal sepsis?,"The United Nations Inter-Agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (UNIGME) estimates that every year 2.5 million neonates die in their first month of life, accounting for nearly one-half of deaths in children under 5 years of age. Neonatal sepsis is the third leading cause of neonatal mortality. The worldwide burden of bacterial sepsis is expected to increase in the next decades due to the lack of effective molecular therapies to replace the administration of antibiotics whose efficacy is compromised by the emergence of resistant strains. In addition, prolonged exposure to antibiotics can have negative effects by increasing the risk of infection by other organisms. With the global burden of sepsis increasing and no vaccine nor other therapeutic approaches proved efficient, the World Health Organization (WHO) stresses the need for new therapeutic targets for sepsis treatment and infection prevention (WHO, A73/32). In response to this unresolved clinical issue, the P2X7 receptor (P2X7R), a key component of the inflammatory cascade, has emerged as a potential target for treating inflammatory/infection diseases. Indeed numerous studies have demonstrated the relevance of the purinergic system as a pharmacological target in addressing immune-mediated inflammatory diseases by regulating immunity, inflammation, and organ function. In this review, we analyze key features of sepsis immunopathophysiology focusing in neonatal sepsis and on how the immunomodulatory role of P2X7R could be a potential pharmacological target for reducing the burden of neonatal sepsis.","Sales Fialho, Patrick Trieu-Cuot, Paula Ferreira, Laura Oliveira",International immunopharmacology,2024,Immunity; Infectious disease; Neonatal sepsis; P2X7 receptor; Purinergic signaling,10.1016/j.intimp.2024.112969,"Department of ImmunoPhysiology and Pharmacology, ICBAS - School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences - University of Porto, Porto, Portugal.; Institut Pasteur, Université Paris Cité, Unité de Biologie des Bactéries Pathogènes à Gram-positif, Paris, France.; Department of ImmunoPhysiology and Pharmacology, ICBAS - School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences - University of Porto, Porto, Portugal; Institute of Research and Innovation in Health (i3S), University of Porto, Porto, Portugal; Institute for Molecular and Cell Biology (IBMC), University of Porto, Porto, Portugal.; Department of ImmunoPhysiology and Pharmacology, ICBAS - School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences - University of Porto, Porto, Portugal; Center for Drug Discovery and Innovative Medicines (MedInUP)/Rise Health, University of Porto, Portugal.

Contributing factors include lack of access to health care and trusted information about vaccines. The National Minority Quality Forum's Center for Sustainable Health Care Quality and Equity collaborated with church pastors, barbers, and hair stylists to disseminate a survey to their communities to assess barriers/facilitators to flu vaccine uptake. The population (n = 262) was mostly Black (93%), female (77%), between the age of 50-64 (39%) and vaccinated (73%). The most common reasons cited by respondents for being vaccinated were personal health, a habit of getting the shot, and a desire not to spread it to others. Among the unvaccinated (27%), the most common reasons for not vaccinating were lack of perceived need, concern the shot would make them sick, and that they do not normally get vaccinated. Vaccine knowledge and trust in health care providers' recommendations was higher amongst vaccinated individuals. Amongst the unvaccinated, trust was lower and there was a stronger belief that the vaccine would not prevent illness. Age was also associated with the likelihood of being vaccinated and greater vaccine knowledge and trust in provider recommendations. Unvaccinated individuals, particularly those under 54 years of age, did not hold strong distrust, attitudes were more neutral, and concern for others was moderate, suggesting an opportunity to target younger age groups. This study highlights the importance of trusted community messengers in conveying targeted messages on the safety and effectiveness of the flu vaccine.","Henry Nuss, Lois Privor-Dumm, Chinonso Ukachukwu, Laura Lee Hall",Journal of racial and ethnic health disparities,2024,Barriers to immunization; Community leaders; Faith-based; Influenza vaccination; Racial disparities; Trust,10.1007/s40615-024-02141-7,"New Orleans School of Public Health, LSU Health, Behavioral Community Health Sciences, New Orleans, LA, USA. hnussj@lsuhsc.edu.; Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, International Vaccine Access Center, Baltimore, MD, USA.; Center for Sustainable Health Care Quality and Equity, National Minority Quality Forum, Washington, DC, USA.; Center for Sustainable Health Care Quality and Equity, National Minority Quality Forum, Washington, DC, USA.",N/A,MSA_2021_011737 (Sanofi),Journal Article

39238004,The multifaceted role of the stroma in the healthy prostate and prostate cancer.,"Prostate cancer (PC) is an age-related disease and represents, after lung cancer, the second cause of cancer death in males worldwide. Mortality is due to the metastatic disease, which mainly involves the bones, lungs, and liver. In the last 20 years, the incidence of metastatic PC has increased in Western Countries, and a further increase is expected in the near future, due to the population ageing. Current treatment options, including state of the art cancer immunotherapy, need to be more effective to achieve long-term disease control. The most significant anatomical barrier to overcome to improve the effectiveness of current and newly designed drug strategies consists of the prostatic stroma, in particular the fibroblasts and the extracellular matrix, which are the most abundant components of both the normal and tumor prostatic microenvironment. By weaving a complex communication network with the glandular epithelium, the immune cells, the microbiota, the endothelium, and the nerves, in the healthy prostatic microenvironment, the fibroblasts and the extracellular matrix support organ development and homeostasis. However, during inflammation, ageing and prostate tumorigenesis, they undergo dramatic phenotypic and genotypic changes, which impact on tumor growth and progression and on the development of therapy resistance. Here, we focus on the characteristics and functions of the prostate associated fibroblasts and of the extracellular matrix in health and cancer. We emphasize their roles in shaping tumor behavior and the feasibility of manipulating and/or targeting these stromal components to overcome the limitations of current treatments and to improve precision medicine's chances of success.","Emma Di Carlo, Carlo Sorrentino",Journal of translational medicine,2024,Ageing population; Desmoplasia; Extracellular matrix; Prostate cancer progression; Prostate cancer-associated fibroblasts; Tumor microenvironment,10.1186/s12967-024-05564-2,"Department of Medicine and Sciences of Aging, ""G. d'Annunzio"" University of Chieti- Pescara, Via dei Vestini, Chieti, 66100, Italy. edicarlo@unich.it.; Department of Medicine and Sciences of Aging, ""G. d'Annunzio"" University of Chieti- Pescara, Via dei Vestini, Chieti, 66100, Italy.",Humans; Male; Prostatic Neoplasms; Stromal Cells; Prostate; Tumor Microenvironment; Extracellular Matrix; Animals; Health; Fibroblasts,IG 2019 - ID. 23264 (Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro); 2014-2020 (PON R&I) (Ministero dell'Università e della Ricerca),Journal Article; Review

39225854,Zero-covid advocacy during the COVID-19 pandemic: a case study of views on Twitter/X.,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, many advocacy groups and individuals criticized governments on social media for doing either too much or too little to mitigate the pandemic. In this article, we review advocacy for COVID-19 elimination or ""zero-covid"" on the social media platform X (Twitter). We present a thematic analysis of tweets by 20 influential co-signatories of the World Health Network letter on ten themes, covering six topics of science and mitigation (zero-covid, epidemiological data on variants, long-term post-acute sequelae (Long COVID), vaccines, schools and children, views on monkeypox/Mpox) and four advocacy methods (personal advice and promoting remedies, use of anecdotes, criticism of other scientists, and of authorities). The advocacy, although timely and informative, often appealed to emotions and values using anecdotes and strong criticism of authorities and other scientists. Many tweets received hundreds or thousands of likes. Risks were emphasized about children's vulnerability, Long COVID, variant severity, and Mpox, and via comparisons with human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV). Far-reaching policies and promotion of remedies were advocated without systematic evidence review, or sometimes, core field expertise. We identified potential conflicts of interest connected to private companies. Our study documents a need for public health debates to be less polarizing and judgmental, and more factual. In order to protect public trust in science during a crisis, we suggest the development of mechanisms to ensure ethical guidelines for engagement in ""science-based"" advocacy, and consideration of cost-benefit analysis of recommendations for public health decision-making.","Kasper P Kepp, Kevin Bardosh, Tijl De Bie, Louise Emilsson, Justin Greaves, Tea Lallukka, Taulant Muka, J Christian Rangel, Niclas Sandström, Michaéla C Schippers, Jonas Schmidt-Chanasit, Tracy Vaillancourt",Monash bioethics review,2024,Advocacy; Pandemic; Science; Social media; Zero-covid,10.1007/s40592-024-00205-2,"Epistudia, Bern, Switzerland. kasper.planeta@epistudia.com.; School of Public Health, University of Washington, Seattle, USA.; IDLab, Department of Electronics and Information Systems (ELIS), Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.; General Practice Research Unit (AFE) and Department of General Practice, Institute of Health and Society, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.; Department of Politics and International Studies, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK.; Department of Public Health, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.; Epistudia, Bern, Switzerland.; Faculty of Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada.; Faculty of Educational Sciences, Department of Education, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.; Department of Organisation and Personnel Management, Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University Rotterdam, Rotterdam, Netherlands.; Faculty of Mathematics, Informatics and Natural Sciences, Universität Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany.; Counselling Psychology, Faculty of Education, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada.",Humans; COVID-19; Social Media; SARS-CoV-2; Pandemics,N/A,Journal Article

39222713,Dasatinib interferes with HIV-1 proviral integration and the inflammatory potential of monocyte-derived macrophages from people with HIV.,"HIV-1 infection is efficiently controlled by the antiretroviral treatment (ART) but viral persistence in long-lived reservoirs formed by CD4 + T cells and macrophages impedes viral eradication and creates a chronic inflammatory environment. Dasatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor clinically used against chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) that has also showed an anti-inflammatory potential. We previously reported that dasatinib is very efficient at interfering with HIV-1 infection of CD4 + T cells by preserving the antiviral activity of SAMHD1, an innate immune factor that blocks T-cell activation and proliferation and that is inactivated by phosphorylation at T592 (pSAMHD1). We observed that short-term treatment in vitro with dasatinib significantly reduced pSAMHD1 in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) isolated from people with HIV (PWH) and healthy donors, interfering with HIV-1 infection. This inhibition was based on low levels of 2-LTR circles and proviral integration, while viral reverse transcription was not affected. MDMs isolated from people with CML on long-term treatment with dasatinib also showed low levels of pSAMHD1 and were resistant to HIV-1 infection. In addition, dasatinib decreased the inflammatory potential of MDMs by reducing the release of M1-related cytokines like TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6, CXCL8, and CXCL9, but preserving the antiviral activity through normal levels of IL-12 and IFNγ. Due to the production of M2-related anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1RA and IL-10 was also impaired, dasatinib appeared to interfere with MDMs differentiation. The use of dasatinib along with ART could be used against HIV-1 reservoir in CD4 and macrophages and to alleviate the chronic inflammation characteristic of PWH.","Sara Rodríguez-Mora, Clara Sánchez-Menéndez, Guiomar Bautista-Carrascosa, Elena Mateos, Lucia Moreno-Serna, Diego Megías, Juan Cantón, Valentín García-Gutiérrez, María Aránzazu Murciano-Antón, Miguel Cervero, Adam Spivak, Vicente Planelles, Mayte Coiras",Biochemical pharmacology,2024,Chronic inflammation; Dasatinib; HIV-1; Monocyte-derived macrophages; SAMHD1; Viral reservoir,10.1016/j.bcp.2024.116512,"Immunopathology and Viral Reservoir Unit, National Center of Microbiology, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Majadahonda, Madrid, Spain; Biomedical Research Center Network in Infectious Diseases (CIBERINFEC), Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Majadahonda, Madrid, Spain.

Recent identification of the gene encoding PEDS1, the desaturase generating the vinyl ether bond, enables evaluation of the role of plasmalogens in health and disease. Here, we report that Peds1-deficient zebrafish larvae display delayed development, increased basal inflammation, normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell emergence, and cell-autonomous myeloid cell apoptosis. In a sterile acute inflammation model, Peds1-deficient larvae exhibited impaired inflammation resolution and tissue regeneration, increased interleukin-1β and NF-κB expression, and elevated ROS levels at the wound site. Abnormal immune cell recruitment, neutrophil persistence, and fewer but predominantly pro-inflammatory macrophages were observed. Chronic skin inflammation worsened in Peds1-deficient larvae but was mitigated by exogenous plasmalogen, which also alleviated hyper-susceptibility to bacterial infection, as did pharmacological inhibition of caspase-3 and colony-stimulating factor 3-induced myelopoiesis. Overall, our results highlight an important role for plasmalogens in myeloid cell biology and inflammation.","Ana B Arroyo, Sylwia D Tyrkalska, Eva Bastida-Martínez, Antonio J Monera-Girona, Joaquín Cantón-Sandoval, Martín Bernal-Carrión, Diana García-Moreno, Montserrat Elías-Arnanz, Victoriano Mulero",Cell death discovery,2024,N/A,10.1038/s41420-024-02141-w,"Inmunidad, Inflamación y Cáncer.

39466921,CRISPR-inhibition screen for lncRNAs linked to melanoma growth and metastasis.,"Melanoma being one of the most common and deadliest skin cancers, has been rising since the past decade. Patients at advanced stages of the disease have very poor prognoses, as opposed to at the earlier stages. Nowadays the standard-of-care of advanced melanoma is resection followed by immune checkpoint inhibition based immunotherapy. However, a substantial proportion of patients either do not respond or develop resistances. This underscores a need for novel approaches and therapeutic targets as well as a better understanding of the mechanisms of melanoma pathogenesis. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) comprise a poorly characterized class of functional players and promising targets in promoting malignancy. Certain lncRNAs have been identified to play integral roles in melanoma progression and drug resistances, however systematic screens to uncover novel functional lncRNAs are scarce. Here, we profile differentially expressed lncRNAs in patient derived short-term metastatic cultures and BRAF-MEK-inhibition resistant cells. We conduct a focused growth-related CRISPR-inhibition screen of overexpressed lncRNAs, validate and functionally characterize lncRNA hits with respect to cellular growth, invasive capacities and apoptosis in vitro as well as the transcriptomic impact of our lead candidate the novel lncRNA XLOC_030781.

39209813,IL-2 and TCR stimulation induce expression and secretion of IL-32β by human T cells.,"IL-32 expression is important for pathogen clearance but detrimental in chronic inflammation, autoimmunity, and cancer. T cells are major IL-32 producers in these diseases and key mediators of pathogen and tumor elimination but also autoimmune destruction. However, their contribution to IL-32 biology during immune responses is hardly understood due to several isoforms with divergent inflammatory properties. Here, we identified IL-32β as the predominant isoform in various T cell subsets of healthy individuals and breast cancer patients with the highest levels detected in intratumoral regulatory T cells. We show that IL-32β is induced by IL-2 but IL-32β release requires T Cell Receptor rather than IL2R stimulation. Using inhibitors of protein secretion pathways and serial (ultra)centrifugation of T cell supernatants, we demonstrate that T cells actively secrete IL-32β unconventionally, as a free protein and, to a minor degree, through exosomes. Thus, our data identify activated T cells as major IL-32β secretors in health and cancer.","Franziska Christine Sanna, Iva Benešová, Philip Pervan, Adriana Krenz, Alexander Wurzel, Robert Lohmayer, Jasmin Mühlbauer, Amélie Wöllner, Nina Köhl, Ayse Nur Menevse, Slava Stamova, Valentina Volpin, Philipp Beckhove, Maria Xydia",Frontiers in immunology,2024,IL-2; IL-32 isoform; IL-32 secretion mechanism; IL-32β; T cells; cancer; exosomes; unconventional secretion pathway,10.3389/fimmu.2024.1437224,"Interventional Immunology, Leibniz Institute for Immunotherapy, Regensburg, Germany.; Interventional Immunology, Leibniz Institute for Immunotherapy, Regensburg, Germany.; Interventional Immunology, Leibniz Institute for Immunotherapy, Regensburg, Germany.; Interventional Immunology, Leibniz Institute for Immunotherapy, Regensburg, Germany.; Interventional Immunology, Leibniz Institute for Immunotherapy, Regensburg, Germany.; Interventional Immunology, Leibniz Institute for Immunotherapy, Regensburg, Germany.; Interventional Immunology, Leibniz Institute for Immunotherapy, Regensburg, Germany.; Department of Internal Medicine III, Hematology and Medical Oncology, University Medical Center, Regensburg, Germany.; Department of Internal Medicine III, Hematology and Medical Oncology, University Medical Center, Regensburg, Germany.; Interventional Immunology, Leibniz Institute for Immunotherapy, Regensburg, Germany.; Interventional Immunology, Leibniz Institute for Immunotherapy, Regensburg, Germany.; Interventional Immunology, Leibniz Institute for Immunotherapy, Regensburg, Germany.; Interventional Immunology, Leibniz Institute for Immunotherapy, Regensburg, Germany.; Interventional Immunology, Leibniz Institute for Immunotherapy, Regensburg, Germany.","Humans; Interleukins; Interleukin-2; Breast Neoplasms; Female; Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell; Lymphocyte Activation; T-Lymphocyte Subsets; T-Lymphocytes",N/A,Journal Article

39211087,"""Glycans in Trained Immunity: Educators of innate immune memory in homeostasis and disease"".","Trained Immunity is defined as a biological process normally induced by exogenous or endogenous insults that triggers epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming events associated with long-term adaptation of innate immune cells. This trained phenotype confers enhanced responsiveness to subsequent triggers, resulting in an innate immune ""memory"" effect. Trained Immunity, in the past decade, has revealed important benefits for host defense and homeostasis, but can also induce potentially harmful outcomes associated with chronic inflammatory disorders or autoimmune diseases. Interestingly, evidence suggest that the ""trainers"" prompting trained immunity are frequently glycans structures. In fact, the exposure of different types of glycans at the surface of pathogens is a key driver of the training phenotype, leading to the reprogramming of innate immune cells through the recognition of those glycan-triggers by a variety of glycan-binding proteins (GBPs) expressed by the immune cells. β-glucan or mannose-enriched structures in Candida albicans are some of the examples that highlight the potential of glycans in trained immunity, both in homeostasis and in disease. In this review, we will discuss the relevance of glycans exposed by pathogens in establishing key immunological hubs with glycan-recognizing receptors expressed in immune cells, highlighting how this glycan-GBP network can impact trained immunity. Finally, we discuss the power of glycans and GBPs as potential targets in trained immunity, envisioning potential therapeutic applications.","Pedro Almeida, Ângela Fernandes, Inês Alves, Salomé S Pinho",Carbohydrate research,2024,BCG; Candida albicans; Glycan-binding proteins; Glycans; Tolerance; Trained immunity,10.1016/j.carres.2024.109245,"I3S - Institute for Research and Innovation in Health, University of Porto, 4200-135, Porto, Portugal.

39211068,Developing and validating a tool for assessing the confidence in the competence of midwifery tutors in India on WHO core competency domains.,"Negligible quantitative research evidence exists on standardisation and psychometric validation of questionnaires that measure midwifery educators' confidence in their competence. This study developed a self-assessment of confidence in competence questionnaire in India based on the WHO Midwifery Educator Core Competencies (2014) with an aim to develop and validate a self-assessment tool measuring midwifery tutors' confidence in competence in imparting quality midwifery education. The questionnaire was developed as part of a multi-centre study to identify confident midwifery tutors for further training as educators, supporting India's rollout of professional midwives. The questionnaire underwent rigorous psychometric testing among 2016 midwifery tutors in India. Following exploratory Principal Component Analyses (PCA), the nine core competencies outlined in the WHO document were analysed separately. The results indicate that the questionnaire is psychometrically valid, with an internal consistency range of 0.81-0.93 for the nine domains. This robust testing process ensures the reliability and validity of the questionnaire. The self-assessment questionnaire can potentially be a valuable tool in India and other high-, middle-, and low-income countries. From a programmatic perspective, it can help identify key gaps and prioritise training needs, particularly in low-resource settings, so that limited resources are best utilised to fill the most prominent gaps. Furthermore, it can provide a universal platform for comparing data from different settings, facilitating global collaboration and learning in midwifery education.","Paridhi Jha, Bharati Sharma, Prabhu Ponnusamy, Purna Chandra Sahoo, Vikas Kumar Jha, Nishtha Kathuria, Devika Mehra, Sunanda Gupta, Arvind Pandey, Ram Chahar, Frances Emma McConville, Medha Gandhi, Malin Bogren",PLOS global public health,2024,N/A,10.1371/journal.pgph.0003626,"Foundation for Research in Health Systems (FRHS), Bengaluru, Karnataka, India.; Indian Institute of Public Health, Gandhinagar, Gujarat, India.; Mamta Health Institute of Mother and Child, New Delhi, India.; Foundation for Research in Health Systems (FRHS), Bengaluru, Karnataka, India.; Foundation for Research in Health Systems (FRHS), Bengaluru, Karnataka, India.; Mamta Health Institute of Mother and Child, New Delhi, India.; Mamta Health Institute of Mother and Child, New Delhi, India.; World Health Organization, India Office, New Delhi, India.; World Health Organization, India Office, New Delhi, India.; World Health Organization, India Office, New Delhi, India.; World Health Organization, Headquarters, Geneva, Switzerland.; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Lead, Program Advocacy: Family Health, Immunization & Infectious Diseases, New Delhi, India.; Institute of Health and Care Sciences, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.",N/A,N/A,Journal Article
39211051,Contactomics of Microglia and Intercellular Communication.,"Microglia represent the main immunocompetent cell type in the parenchyma of the brain and the spinal cord, with roles extending way beyond their immune functions. While emerging data show the pivotal role of microglia in brain development, brain health and brain diseases, the exact mechanisms through which microglia contribute to complex neuroimmune interactions are still largely unclear. Understanding the communication between microglia and other cells represents an important cornerstone of these interactions, which may provide novel opportunities for therapeutic interventions in neurological or psychiatric disorders. As such, in line with studying the effects of the numerous soluble mediators that influence neuroimmune processes, attention on physical interactions between microglia and other cells in the CNS has increased substantially in recent years. In this chapter, we briefly summarize the latest literature on ""microglial contactomics"" and its functional implications in health and disease.","Csaba Cserép, Balázs Pósfai, Eszter Szabadits, Ádám Dénes",Advances in neurobiology,2024,Brain disease; Cell–cell interactions; Contactomics; Inflammation; Microglia,10.1007/978-3-031-55529-9_8,"""Momentum"" Laboratory of Neuroimmunology, Institute of Experimental Medicine, Budapest, Hungary.; ""Momentum"" Laboratory of Neuroimmunology, Institute of Experimental Medicine, Budapest, Hungary.; ""Momentum"" Laboratory of Neuroimmunology, Institute of Experimental Medicine, Budapest, Hungary.; ""Momentum"" Laboratory of Neuroimmunology, Institute of Experimental Medicine, Budapest, Hungary. denes.adam@koki.hu.",Microglia; Humans; Cell Communication; Brain; Animals; Neuroimmunomodulation,N/A,Journal Article; Review
39210517,History of Microglia.,"The term 'microglia' was first introduced into the scientific literature a century ago. The various eras of microglial research have been defined not only by the number of reports subsequently generated but, more critically, also by the concepts that have shaped our present-day views and understanding of microglia. Key methods, technologies, and models, as well as seminal discoveries made possible through their deployment have enabled breakthroughs, and now pave the way for lines of investigation that could not have been anticipated even a decade ago. Advances in our understanding of the microglial origin, forms, and functions have relied fundamentally on parallel developments in immunology. As the 'neuro-immune' cells of the brain, microglia are now under the spotlight in various disciplines. This chapter surveys the gradual processes and precipitous events that helped form ideas concerning the developmental origin of microglia and their roles in health and disease. It first covers the dawning phase during which the early pioneers of microglial research discovered cellular entities and already assigned functions to them. Following a recess period, the 1960s brought about a renaissance of active interest, with the development of tools and models-and fundamental notions on microglial contributions to central nervous system (CNS) pathologies. These seminal efforts laid the foundation for the awakening of a sweeping research era beginning in the 1980s and spurred on by a blast of immunological discoveries. Finally, this chapter stresses the advancements in molecular, genetic, and imaging approaches to the study of microglia with the turn of the millennium, enabling insights into virtually all facets of microglial physiology. Moving forward, it is clear that the future holds substantial promise for further discoveries. The next epoch in the history of microglial research has just begun.","Payam Rezaie, Uwe-Karsten Hanisch",Advances in neurobiology,2024,Developmental origin; Methods; Microglia; Models; Pathology; Physiology; Roles; Technologies,10.1007/978-3-031-55529-9_2,"School of Life, Health & Chemical Sciences, Faculty of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics, The Open University, Milton Keynes, UK. payam.rezaie@open.ac.uk.; Institute of Neuropathology, University of Göttingen, Göttingen, Germany.","Animals; Humans; Central Nervous System; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; Microglia",N/A,Historical Article; Journal Article
39208605,The airway mycobiome and interactions with immunity in health and chronic lung disease.,"The existence of commensal fungi that reside within the respiratory tract, termed the airway mycobiome, has only recently been discovered. Studies are beginning to characterize the spectrum of fungi that inhabit the human upper and lower respiratory tract but heterogeneous sampling and analysis techniques have limited the generalizability of findings to date. In this review, we discuss existing studies that have examined the respiratory mycobiota in healthy individuals and in those with inflammatory lung conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cystic fibrosis. Associations between specific fungi and features of disease pathogenesis are emerging but the precise functional consequences imparted by mycobiota upon the immune system remain poorly understood.

39208272,Rigid Macrocycle Metal Complexes as CXCR4 Chemokine Receptor Antagonists: Influence of Ring Size.,"Understanding the role of chemokine receptors in health and disease has been of increasing interest in recent years. Chemokine receptor CXCR4 has been extensively studied because of its defined role in immune cell trafficking, HIV infection, inflammatory diseases, and cancer progression. We have developed high affinity rigidified CXCR4 antagonists that incorporate metal ions to optimize the binding interactions with the aspartate side chains at the extracellular surface of the CXCR4 chemokine receptor and increase the residence time. Cross- and side-bridged tetraazamacrocylic complexes offer significant advantages over the non-bridged molecular structures in terms of receptor affinity, potential for radiolabelling, and use in therapeutic applications. Our investigation has been extended to the influence of the ring size on bridged tetraazamacrocyclic compounds with the addition of two novel chelators (bis-cross-bridged homocyclen and bis-cross-bridged cyclen) to compare to the bis-bridged cyclam, along with novel metal complexes formed with copper(II) or zinc(II). The in vitro biological assays showed that all of the zinc(II) complexes are high affinity antagonists with a marked increase in CXCR4 selectivity for the bis-cross-bridged cyclen complex, whereas the properties of the copper(II) complexes are highly dependent on metal ion geometry. X-ray crystal structural data and DFT computational studies allow for the rationalisation of the relative affinities and the aspartate residue interactions on the protein surface. Changing the ring size from 14-membered can increase the selectivity for the CXCR4 receptor whilst retaining potent inhibitory activity, improving the key pharmacological characteristics.","Isaline Renard, Thomas D'huys, Benjamin P Burke, Trisha Ajoleza, Amy N Cain, Neil L Funwie, Abid Khan, Danny L Maples, Randall D Maples, Dallas L Matz, Graeme McRobbie, Robert Ullom, Timothy J Prior, Douglas P Linder, Tom Van Loy, Timothy J Hubin, Dominique Schols, Stephen J Archibald",Pharmaceutics,2024,AMD3100; CXCR4; Plerixafor; cancer therapeutics; cyclam; macrocycle; molecular imaging,10.3390/pharmaceutics16081000,"Centre for Biomedicine and Positron Emission Tomography Research Centre, The University of Hull, Cottingham Road, Hull HU6 7RX, UK.; Division of Virology and Chemotherapy, Rega Institute for Medical Research, KU Leuven, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.; Centre for Biomedicine and Positron Emission Tomography Research Centre, The University of Hull, Cottingham Road, Hull HU6 7RX, UK.; Department of Chemistry and Physics, Southwestern Oklahoma State University, Weatherford, OK 73096, USA.; Department of Chemistry and Physics, Southwestern Oklahoma State University, Weatherford, OK 73096, USA.; Department of Chemistry and Physics, Southwestern Oklahoma State University, Weatherford, OK 73096, USA.; Centre for Biomedicine and Positron Emission Tomography Research Centre, The University of Hull, Cottingham Road, Hull HU6 7RX, UK.; Department of Chemistry and Physics, Southwestern Oklahoma State University, Weatherford, OK 73096, USA.; Department of Chemistry and Physics, Southwestern Oklahoma State University, Weatherford, OK 73096, USA.; Department of Chemistry and Physics, Southwestern Oklahoma State University, Weatherford, OK 73096, USA.; Centre for Biomedicine and Positron Emission Tomography Research Centre, The University of Hull, Cottingham Road, Hull HU6 7RX, UK.; Department of Chemistry and Physics, Southwestern Oklahoma State University, Weatherford, OK 73096, USA.; Chemistry, Faculty of Science and Engineering, The University of Hull, Cottingham Road, Hull HU6 7RX, UK.; Department of Chemistry and Physics, Southwestern Oklahoma State University, Weatherford, OK 73096, USA.; Division of Virology and Chemotherapy, Rega Institute for Medical Research, KU Leuven, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.; Department of Chemistry and Physics, Southwestern Oklahoma State University, Weatherford, OK 73096, USA.; Division of Virology and Chemotherapy, Rega Institute for Medical Research, KU Leuven, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.; Centre for Biomedicine and Positron Emission Tomography Research Centre, The University of Hull, Cottingham Road, Hull HU6 7RX, UK.",N/A,HEND376 (Yorkshire Cancer Research); EP/V055836/2 (Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council); GOA/10/014 (KU Leuven); PF/10/018 (KU Leuven); C22/17/008 (KU Leuven); Project No. HR13-157 (Oklahoma Center for the Advancement of Science and Technology); G.0485.08 (Foundation of Scientific Research); G.0528.12 (Foundation of Scientific Research); MC_PC_18049 (Medical Research Council); 8P20M103447 (National Center for Research Resources and the National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health),Journal Article

This study explored the factors believed to influence parental decision making regarding vaccine uptake for students with intellectual disability and/or on the autism spectrum attending special schools in New South Wales, Australia, from the perspective of all stakeholders involved in the program. Focus groups and interviews were conducted with 40 participants, including parents, school staff, and immunisation providers. The thematic analysis identified two themes: (1) appreciating diverse parental attitudes towards vaccination and (2) educating parents and managing vaccination questions and concerns. While most parents were described as pro-vaccination, others were anti-vaccination or vaccination-hesitant, articulating a marked protectiveness regarding their child's health. Reasons for vaccine hesitancy included beliefs that vaccines cause autism, concerns that the vaccination may be traumatic for the child, vaccination fatigue following COVID-19, and assumptions that children with disability will not be sexually active. Special school staff regarded the vaccination information pack as inadequate for families, and nurses described limited educational impact resulting from minimal direct communication with parents.

39206335,Progress on the Anti-Inflammatory Activity and Structure-Efficacy Relationship of Polysaccharides from Medical and Edible Homologous Traditional Chinese Medicines.,"Medicinal food varieties developed according to the theory of medical and edible homologues are effective at preventing and treating chronic diseases and in health care. As of 2022, 110 types of traditional Chinese medicines from the same source of medicine and food have been published by the National Health Commission. Inflammation is the immune system's first response to injury, infection, and stress. Chronic inflammation is closely related to many diseases such as atherosclerosis and cancer. Therefore, timely intervention for inflammation is the mainstay treatment for other complex diseases. However, some traditional anti-inflammatory drugs on the market are commonly associated with a number of adverse effects, which seriously affect the health and safety of patients. Therefore, the in-depth development of new safe, harmless, and effective anti-inflammatory drugs has become a hot topic of research and an urgent clinical need. Polysaccharides, one of the main active ingredients of medical and edible homologous traditional Chinese medicines (MEHTCMs), have been confirmed by a large number of studies to exert anti-inflammatory effects through multiple targets and are considered potential natural anti-inflammatory drugs. In addition, the structure of medical and edible homologous traditional Chinese medicines' polysaccharides (MEHTCMPs) may be the key factor determining their anti-inflammatory activity, which makes the underlying the anti-inflammatory effects of polysaccharides and their structure-efficacy relationship hot topics of domestic and international research. However, due to the limitations of the current analytical techniques and tools, the structures have not been fully elucidated and the structure-efficacy relationship is relatively ambiguous, which are some of the difficulties in the process of developing and utilizing MEHTCMPs as novel anti-inflammatory drugs in the future. For this reason, this paper summarizes the potential anti-inflammatory mechanisms of MEHTCMPs, such as the regulation of the Toll-like receptor-related signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, JAK-STAT signaling pathway, NLRP3 signaling pathway, PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, PPAR-γ signaling pathway, Nrf2-HO-1 signaling pathway, and the regulation of intestinal flora, and it systematically analyzes and evaluates the relationships between the anti-inflammatory activity of MEHTCMPs and their structures.","Yuanyuan Zhang, Xiulian Lin, Li Xia, Suhui Xiong, Bohou Xia, Jingchen Xie, Yan Lin, Limei Lin, Ping Wu","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2024,MAPK signaling pathway; Toll-like receptor-related signaling pathway; anti-inflammatory; conformational relationship; medicinal food; polysaccharide,10.3390/molecules29163852,"School of Pharmacy, Hunan University of Chinese Medicine, Changsha 410208, China.; School of Pharmacy, Hunan University of Chinese Medicine, Changsha 410208, China.; School of Pharmacy, Hunan University of Chinese Medicine, Changsha 410208, China.; School of Pharmacy, Hunan University of Chinese Medicine, Changsha 410208, China.; School of Pharmacy, Hunan University of Chinese Medicine, Changsha 410208, China.; School of Pharmacy, Hunan University of Chinese Medicine, Changsha 410208, China.; School of Pharmacy, Hunan University of Chinese Medicine, Changsha 410208, China.; School of Pharmacy, Hunan University of Chinese Medicine, Changsha 410208, China.; School of Pharmacy, Hunan University of Chinese Medicine, Changsha 410208, China.","Humans; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Medicine, Chinese Traditional; Polysaccharides; Structure-Activity Relationship; Drugs, Chinese Herbal; Animals; Inflammation",Z2023JBGS05 (Li-mei Lin),Journal Article; Review

(2) The methods involved a systematic review of randomized controlled trials retrieved from databases in health sciences (Pubmed, CINHAL, Scopus, WOS, ProQuest, Cuiden Plus, InDICEs-CSIC). PRISMA guidelines were followed. (3) Results: Twelve trials were included. Four involved venipuncture, four involved surgical procedures, one involved vaccination, one involved burn care, one involved secondary wound closure, and the last one involved subcutaneous port access. (4) Discussion: Children who undergo medical procedures often experience pain and anxiety, which affects their physical condition and their relationships with caregivers and health professionals. Immersive VR is an effective alternative to medications to help in these cases. No author found statistically significant differences against the use of VR for distraction and palliation of pain and anxiety, which seems to be more effective at a younger age.

39204045,Fenestrated Endothelial Cells across Organs: Insights into Kidney Function and Disease.,"In the human body, the vascular system plays an indispensable role in maintaining homeostasis by supplying oxygen and nutrients to cells and organs and facilitating the removal of metabolic waste and toxins. Blood vessels-the key constituents of the vascular system-are composed of a layer of endothelial cells on their luminal surface. In most organs, tightly packed endothelial cells serve as a barrier separating blood and lymph from surrounding tissues. Intriguingly, endothelial cells in some tissues and organs (e.g., choroid plexus, liver sinusoids, small intestines, and kidney glomerulus) form transcellular pores called fenestrations that facilitate molecular and ionic transport across the vasculature and mediate immune responses through leukocyte transmigration. However, the development and unique functions of endothelial cell fenestrations across organs are yet to be fully uncovered. This review article provides an overview of fenestrated endothelial cells in multiple organs. We describe their development and organ-specific roles, with expanded discussions on their contributions to glomerular health and disease. We extend these discussions to highlight the dynamic changes in endothelial cell fenestrations in diabetic nephropathy, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, Alport syndrome, and preeclampsia, and how these unique cellular features could be targeted for therapeutic development. Finally, we discuss emerging technologies for in vitro modeling of biological systems, and their relevance for advancing the current understanding of endothelial cell fenestrations in health and disease.","Xingrui Mou, Sophia M Leeman, Yasmin Roye, Carmen Miller, Samira Musah",International journal of molecular sciences,2024,disease models; endothelial cells; fenestrations; glomerulus; kidney disease; microphysiological systems; vasculature,10.3390/ijms25169107,"Department of Biomedical Engineering, Pratt School of Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC 27710, USA.; Department of Biomedical Engineering, Pratt School of Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC 27710, USA.; Department of Biomedical Engineering, Pratt School of Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC 27710, USA.; Department of Biology, Duke University, Durham, NC 27710, USA.; Department of Biomedical Engineering, Pratt School of Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC 27710, USA.",Humans; Endothelial Cells; Animals; Kidney; Kidney Diseases,DP2 DK139544 (NIDDK NIH HHS); DP2DK139544 (NIH HHS),Journal Article; Review

The gut microbiota is being increasingly recognized as a critical player in maintaining homeostasis, contributing to the main functions of the intestine and distal organs such as the brain. However, gut dysbiosis, characterized by composition and function alterations of microbiota with intestinal barrier dysfunction has been linked to the development and progression of several pathologies, including intestinal inflammatory diseases, systemic autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatic arthritis, and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, oral microbiota research has gained significant interest in recent years due to its potential impact on overall health. Emerging evidence on the role of microbiota-host interactions in health and disease has triggered a marked interest on the functional role of bacterial extracellular vesicles (BEVs) as mediators of inter-kingdom communication. Accumulating evidence reveals that BEVs mediate host interactions by transporting and delivering into host cells effector molecules that modulate host signaling pathways and cell processes, influencing health and disease. This review discusses the critical role of BEVs from the gut, lung, skin and oral cavity in the epithelium, immune system, and CNS interactions.","Paola Margutti, Antonella D'Ambrosio, Silvia Zamboni",International journal of molecular sciences,2024,bacterial extracellular vesicles; dysbiosis; gut-brain axis; immune-cell-response; microbiota; neuroninflammation,10.3390/ijms25168722,"Department of Neurosciences, Istituto Superiore di Sanità, 00161 Rome, Italy.; Department of Neurosciences, Istituto Superiore di Sanità, 00161 Rome, Italy.; Department of Neurosciences, Istituto Superiore di Sanità, 00161 Rome, Italy.",Humans; Extracellular Vesicles; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Animals; Dysbiosis; Microbiota; Host Microbial Interactions; Bacteria,N/A,Journal Article; Review

39201910,Placenta Extracellular Vesicles: Messengers Connecting Maternal and Fetal Systems.,"The placenta operates during gestation as the primary communication organ between the mother and fetus. It is essential for gas, nutrient exchange, and fetal waste transfer. The placenta also produces a wide range of hormones and other factors that influence maternal physiology, including survival and activity of the corpus luteum of the ovary, but the means whereby the placenta shapes fetal development remain less clear, although the fetal brain is thought to be dependent upon the placenta for factors that play roles in its early differentiation and growth, giving rise to the term ""placenta-brain axis"". Placental hormones transit via the maternal and fetal vasculature, but smaller placental molecules require protection from fetal and maternal metabolism. Such biomolecules include small RNA, mRNA, peptides, lipids, and catecholamines that include serotonin and dopamine. These compounds presumably shuttle to maternal and fetal systems via protective extracellular vesicles (EVs). Placental EVs (pEVs) and their components, in particular miRNA (miRs), are known to play important roles in regulating maternal systems, such as immune, cardiovascular, and reproductive functions. A scant amount is known about how pEVs affect fetal cells and tissues. The composition of pEVs can be influenced by gestational diseases. This review will provide critical insight into the roles of pEVs as the intermediary link between maternal and fetal systems, the impact of maternal pathologies on pEV cargo contents, and how an understanding of biomolecular changes within pEVs in health and disease might be utilized to design early diagnostic and mitigation strategies to prevent gestational diseases and later offspring disorders.",Cheryl S Rosenfeld,Biomolecules,2024,DOHaD; endocrine disrupting chemicals; exosomes; miRNA; neurogenesis; neurotransmitters; preeclampsia; trophoblast,10.3390/biom14080995,"Biomedical Sciences, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211, USA.",Humans; Female; Extracellular Vesicles; Pregnancy; Placenta; Maternal-Fetal Exchange; MicroRNAs; Animals; Fetus,N/A,Journal Article; Review

39201409,Systemic and local regulation of hematopoietic homeostasis in health and disease.,"Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) generate all blood cell lineages responsible for tissue oxygenation, life-long hematopoietic homeostasis and immune protection. In adulthood, HSCs primarily reside in the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment, consisting of diverse cell types that constitute the stem cell 'niche'. The adaptability of the hematopoietic system is required to respond to the needs of the host, whether to maintain normal physiology or during periods of physical, psychosocial or environmental stress. Hematopoietic homeostasis is achieved by intricate coordination of systemic and local factors that orchestrate the function of HSCs throughout life. However, homeostasis is not a static process; it modulates HSC and progenitor activity in response to circadian rhythms coordinated by the central and peripheral nervous systems, inflammatory cues, metabolites and pathologic conditions. Here, we review local and systemic factors that impact hematopoiesis, focusing on the implications of aging, stress and cardiovascular disease.","Randall S Carpenter, Maria Maryanovich",Nature cardiovascular research,2024,N/A,10.1038/s44161-024-00482-4,"Department of Cell Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, USA.; Department of Cell Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, USA. maria.marianovich@einsteinmed.edu.",Humans; Homeostasis; Hematopoietic Stem Cells; Hematopoiesis; Animals; Cardiovascular Diseases; Aging; Stem Cell Niche; Signal Transduction; Circadian Rhythm,Scholar Award (American Society of Hematology (ASH)); CRI4994 (Cancer Research Institute (CRI)),Journal Article; Review

We hypothesized that cryoablation may modify the immune microenvironment through direct modulation of the tumor, thereby generating an anti-tumor response in tumors refractory to immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI). In this non-randomized phase II single-center study (NCT03290677), subjects with unresectable melanoma progressing on ICI underwent cryoablation of an enlarging metastasis, and ICI was continued for a minimum of two additional cycles. The primary endpoints were safety, feasibility and tumor response in non-ablated lesions. From May 2018 through July 2020, 17 patients were treated on study.

39194525,Determinants of timely administration of the birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine in Senegal in 2019: Secondary analysis of the demographic and health survey.,"In developing countries, hepatitis B is spread primarily by the perinatal or horizontal route. Thus, the Senegalese government recommends administering the birth dose of the hepatitis B vaccine (HepB0) within 24 hours of birth. The objective was to identify the determinants of timely administration of HepB0 in Senegal in 2019. A secondary analysis of the demographic and health survey was carried out. The study population consisted of children aged 12 to 23 months. A cluster survey, stratified in urban and rural areas, drawn at two stages, was carried out. Individual interviews were conducted. Logistic regression was applied to estimate the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) and their 95% confidence interval. In total, 1130 children were included. Among them, 48.1% were born to mothers aged 25 to 34, 46.8% were male and 82.6% were born in health facilities. The average time between birth and HepB0 administration was 13.1±46.6 days. The median is 0 days [IQR: 0-12] with a minimum of 0 days and a maximum of 414 days. Among 747 children vaccinated, only 65.2% were vaccinated within 24 hours of birth. The determinants were maternal age of at least 35 years (aOR = 2.03 [1.29-3.20]), primary education of the mother (aOR = 1.94 [1.13-3. 35]), at least four antenatal care visits (aOR = 1.74 [1.12-2.69]), belonging to the central (ORa = 0.22 [0.11-0.44]) and northern regions (aOR = 0.18 [0.08-0.40]), and delivery in a health facility (aOR = 3.42 [1.90-6.15]). Education and keeping girls in school, local postnatal care in hard-to-reach regions, promotion of antenatal acre and delivery in a health facility should improve the timeliness of HepB0 vaccination.","Oumar Bassoum, Mouhamadou Faly Ba, Ndeye Mareme Sougou, Adama Sow, Ibrahima Seck",PLOS global public health,2024,N/A,10.1371/journal.pgph.0002734,"Department of preventive medicine and public health, faculty of medicine, pharmacy and odontology, Cheikh Anta Diop University, Dakar, Senegal.; Cheikh Anta Diop University, Dakar, Senegal.; Department of preventive medicine and public health, faculty of medicine, pharmacy and odontology, Cheikh Anta Diop University, Dakar, Senegal.; Department of preventive medicine and public health, faculty of medicine, pharmacy and odontology, Cheikh Anta Diop University, Dakar, Senegal.; Department of preventive medicine and public health, faculty of medicine, pharmacy and odontology, Cheikh Anta Diop University, Dakar, Senegal.",N/A,N/A,Journal Article
39194084,Heart brain axis in health and disease: role of innate and adaptive immunity.,"The importance of the brain-heart interaction has been increasingly recognized as a critical physiological axis that is altered in disease. In this review, we explore the intricate relationship between the central nervous system and cardiovascular health, focusing particularly on immunological mechanisms that influence the course of both neurological and cardiovascular diseases. While previous studies have established a key role of the autonomic nervous system in linking brain and the heart, more recent studies have expanded our understanding of the multifaceted inter-organ interactions. As such, circulating mediators include immune cells of the adaptive and innate immune system and their secreted immunogenic factors have come into the focus as mediators along this bidirectional communication. Hence, in this review we briefly discuss the contribution of the autonomic nervous system and then focus on innate and adaptive immune mechanisms along the heart-to-brain and brain-to-heart axes, illustrating how cardiovascular diseases affect cognitive functions and how brain pathologies lead to cardiac complications.","Alba Simats, Hendrik Sager, Arthur Liesz",Cardiovascular research,2024,N/A,10.1093/cvr/cvae185,"Institute of Biomedical Research of Barcelona (IIBB), Spanish National Research Council (CSIC), Barcelona, Spain.; DZHK (German Center for Cardiovascular Research), partner site Munich.; Institute for Stroke and Dementia Research (ISD), University Medical Center Munich, 81377 Munich, Germany.",N/A,N/A,Journal Article
39193763,"Intestinal Lymphatic Biology, Drug Delivery, and Therapeutics: Current Status and Future Directions.","Historically, the intestinal lymphatics were considered passive conduits for fluids, immune cells, dietary lipids, lipid soluble vitamins, and lipophilic drugs. Studies of intestinal lymphatic drug delivery in the late 20th century focused primarily on the drugs' physicochemical properties, especially high lipophilicity, that resulted in intestinal lymphatic transport. More recent discoveries have changed our traditional view by demonstrating that the lymphatics are active, plastic, and tissue-specific players in a range of biological and pathological processes, including within the intestine. These findings have, in turn, inspired exploration of lymph-specific therapies for a range of diseases, as well as the development of more sophisticated strategies to actively deliver drugs or vaccines to the intestinal lymph, including a range of nanotechnologies, lipid prodrugs, and lipid-conjugated materials that ""hitchhike"" onto lymphatic transport pathways. With the increasing development of novel therapeutics such as biologics, there has been interest in whether these therapeutics are absorbed and transported through intestinal lymph after oral administration. Here we review the current state of understanding of the anatomy and physiology of the gastrointestinal lymphatic system in health and disease, with a focus on aspects relevant to drug delivery. We summarize the current state-of-the-art approaches to deliver drugs and quantify their uptake into the intestinal lymphatic system. Finally, and excitingly, we discuss recent examples of significant pharmacokinetic and therapeutic benefits achieved via intestinal lymphatic drug delivery. We also propose approaches to advance the development and clinical application of intestinal lymphatic delivery strategies in the future.

39191779,"Why fall for misinformation? Role of information processing strategies, health consciousness, and overconfidence in health literacy.","Health misinformation, defined as false or misleading claims lacking scientific evidence, poses a significant threat to public health. This paper investigates factors associated with the failure to discern misinformation, including health consciousness, information processing strategies, and inaccurate self-assessments of health literacy. Through an online experiment involving 707 English-speaking U.S. participants (mean age = 43 years, 56.2% female), we found that misinformation beliefs about nutrition, vaccination, vaping, and cancer were significantly correlated, implying susceptibility across health topics. Greater susceptibility was associated with higher health consciousness, lower objective health literacy, more elaboration, and more selective scanning. Results provided evidence for the Dunning-Kruger effect and metacognitive monitoring errors, whereby confident individuals were unaware of inadequate health literacy and showed poor misinformation identification. Findings suggest that promoting both health literacy education and cognitive reflection skills among the general adult population could empower them to more critically evaluate online health information.","Rachel X Peng, Fuyuan Shen",Journal of health psychology,2024,Dunning-Kruger effect; health literacy; health misinformation; metacognitive monitoring,10.1177/13591053241273647,"Louisiana State University, USA.; Pennsylvania State University, USA.",N/A,N/A,Journal Article

39180327,Hormonal orchestra: mastering mitochondria's role in health and disease.,"Mitochondria is a subcellular organelle involved in the pathogenesis of cellular stress, immune responses, differentiation, metabolic disorders, aging, and death by regulating process of fission, fusion, mitophagy, and transport. However, an increased interest in mitochondria as powerhouse for ATP production, the mechanisms of mitochondria-mediated cellular dysfunction in response to hormonal interaction remains unknown. Mitochondrial matrix contains chaperones and proteases that regulate intrinsic apoptosis pathway through pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family's proteins Bax/Bak, and Cyt C release, and induces caspase-dependent and independent cells death. Energy and growth regulators such as thyroid hormones have profound effect on mitochondrial inner membrane protein and lipid compositions, ATP production by regulating oxidative phosphorylation system. Mitochondria contain cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme, P450scc, ferredoxin, and ferredoxin reductase providing an essential site for steroid hormones biosynthesis. In line with this, neurohormones such as oxytocin, vasopressin, and melatonin are correlated with mitochondrial integrity, displaying therapeutic implications for inflammatory and immune responses. Melatonin's also displayed protective role against oxidative stress and mitochondrial synthesis of ROS, suggesting a defense mechanism against aging-related diseases. An imbalance in mitochondrial bioenergetics can cause neurodegenerative disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and cancers. Hormone-induced PGC-1α stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis via activation of NRF1 and NRF2, which in turn triggers mtTFA in brown adipose and cardiac myocytes. Mitochondria can be transferred through cells merging, exosome-mediated transfer, and tunneling through nanotubes. By delineating the underlying molecular mechanism of hormonal mitochondrial interaction, this study reviews the dynamics mechanisms of mitochondria and its effects on cellular level, health, diseases, and therapeutic strategies targeting mitochondrial diseases.","Ebtesam Al-Suhaimi, Rahaf AlQuwaie, Reem AlSaqabi, Dwi Winarni, Firli Rahmah Primula Dewi, Abdullah A AlRubaish, Adeeb Shehzad, Abdelhamid Elaissari",Endocrine,2024,Bioenergetics; Brain Disease; Hormones; Mitochondria; Pathophysiology,10.1007/s12020-024-03967-1,"Vice presidency for Scientific Research and Innovation, Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University, Dammam, Saudi Arabia. ealsuhaimi@iau.edu.sa.; Master Program of Biotechnology, Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University, Dammam, Saudi Arabia.; Master Program of Biotechnology, Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University, Dammam, Saudi Arabia.; Department of Biology, Faculty of Science and Technology, Universitas Airlangga, Surabaya, East Java, Indonesia.; Department of Biology, Faculty of Science and Technology, Universitas Airlangga, Surabaya, East Java, Indonesia.; College of Medicine, Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University, Dammam, Saudi Arabia.; Biodiversity Unit, Research Center, Dhofar University, Salalah, Oman.; Universite Claude Bernard Lyon-1, CNRS, ISA-UMR 5280, Villeurbanne, France.",Humans; Mitochondria; Animals; Hormones; Energy Metabolism,N/A,Journal Article; Review

39175178,Anal HPV prevalence in individuals with and without other concomitant sexually transmitted infections.,"The association between human papillomavirus (HPV) and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in anal lesions still remains unclear. Aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of simultaneous infection of HPV and Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Mycoplasma genitalium, and Trichomonas vaginalis in individuals screened for HPV anal infection. A total of 507 anal samples were tested for both anal HPV and STIs: 16% resulted positive for one or more non-HPV STIs. Specifically, C. trachomatis, M. genitalium, and N. gonorrhoeae were detected in 8%, 5%, and 4% of cases, respectively. Two groups were considered, including a positive STI group and a negative STI group. The prevalence of HPV was similar in patients in both groups: high risk (HR)-HPV and low risk (LR)-HPV were 67% and 53% versus 62% (p = 0.361) and 54% (p = 0.864) of patients, respectively. However, HPV 16, 18, 35, 51, 59, and 69 were significantly more frequent in patients tested positive for other STIs versus HPV infection alone (p < 0.05). No significant differences between the two groups were observed in vaccination coverage, 28% versus 32% (p = 0.463), and HIV status, 86% versus 84% (p = 0.658). The study shows that the overall HPV status is not directly correlated to other STIs in the investigated population, except for certain HPV types, including HR-HPV 16, reinforcing the urge for a greater vaccination coverage.","Alberto Rizzo, Davide Moschese, Federica Salari, Andrea Giacomelli, Andrea Cavallo, Maria Vittoria Cossu, Loriana Morelli, Chiara Fusetti, Giorgia Carrozzo, Serena Reato, Valeria Micheli, Spinello Antinori, Alessandra Lombardi, Andrea Gori, Maria Rita Gismondo",Journal of medical virology,2024,anus; chlamydia; gonorrhea; mycoplasma; papillomavirus; trichomoniasis,10.1002/jmv.29852,"Laboratory of Clinical Microbiology, Virology and Bioemergencies, Luigi Sacco Hospital, ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco, Milan, Italy.; I Infectious Diseases Unit, Luigi Sacco Hospital, ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco, Milan, Italy.; Laboratory of Clinical Microbiology, Virology and Bioemergencies, Luigi Sacco Hospital, ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco, Milan, Italy.; III Infectious Diseases Unit, Luigi Sacco Hospital, ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco, Milan, Italy.; Laboratory of Clinical Microbiology, Virology and Bioemergencies, Luigi Sacco Hospital, ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco, Milan, Italy.; I Infectious Diseases Unit, Luigi Sacco Hospital, ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco, Milan, Italy.; Laboratory of Clinical Microbiology, Virology and Bioemergencies, Luigi Sacco Hospital, ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco, Milan, Italy.; I Infectious Diseases Unit, Luigi Sacco Hospital, ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco, Milan, Italy.; III Infectious Diseases Unit, Luigi Sacco Hospital, ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco, Milan, Italy.; III Infectious Diseases Unit, Luigi Sacco Hospital, ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco, Milan, Italy.; Laboratory of Clinical Microbiology, Virology and Bioemergencies, Luigi Sacco Hospital, ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco, Milan, Italy.; III Infectious Diseases Unit, Luigi Sacco Hospital, ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco, Milan, Italy.; Laboratory of Clinical Microbiology, Virology and Bioemergencies, Luigi Sacco Hospital, ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco, Milan, Italy.; III Infectious Diseases Unit, Luigi Sacco Hospital, ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco, Milan, Italy.; Laboratory of Clinical Microbiology, Virology and Bioemergencies, Luigi Sacco Hospital, ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco, Milan, Italy.",Humans; Female; Prevalence; Adult; Male; Papillomavirus Infections; Middle Aged; Sexually Transmitted Diseases; Young Adult; Coinfection; Adolescent; Anal Canal; Mycoplasma genitalium; Papillomaviridae; Aged; Chlamydia trachomatis; Gonorrhea; Chlamydia Infections; Trichomonas vaginalis; Mycoplasma Infections; Neisseria gonorrhoeae,N/A,Journal Article
39173193,Cathepsin C in health and disease: from structural insights to therapeutic prospects.,"Cathepsin C (CTSC) is a lysosomal cysteine protease constitutively expressed at high levels in the lung, kidney, liver, and spleen. It plays a key role in the activation of serine proteases in cytotoxic T cells, natural killer cells (granzymes A and B), mast cells (chymase and tryptase) and neutrophils (cathepsin G, neutrophil elastase, proteinase 3) underscoring its pivotal significance in immune and inflammatory defenses. Here, we comprehensively review the structural attributes, synthesis, and function of CTSC, with a focus on its variants implicated in the etiopathology of several syndromes associated with neutrophil serine proteases, including Papillon-Lefevre syndrome (PLS), Haim-Munk Syndrome (HMS), and aggressive periodontitis (AP). These syndromes are characterized by palmoplantar hyperkeratosis, and early-onset periodontitis (severe gum disease) resulting in premature tooth loss. Due to the critical role played by CTSC in these and several other conditions it is being explored as a potential therapeutic target for autoimmune and inflammatory disorders. The review also discusses in depth the gene variants of CTSC, and in particular their postulated association with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), COVID-19, various cancers, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis, sudden cardiac death (SCD), atherosclerotic vascular disease, and neuroinflammatory disease. Finally, the therapeutic potential of CTSC across a range of human diseases is discussed.","Chakriya Chitsamankhun, Nutwara Siritongtaworn, B P J Fournier, Kanokwan Sriwattanapong, Thanakorn Theerapanon, Lakshman Samaranayake, Thantrira Porntaveetus",Journal of translational medicine,2024,Atherosclerosis; Cathepsin C; Inflammation; Palmoplantar hyperkeratosis; Papillon–Lefevre syndrome; Periodontitis; Protease,10.1186/s12967-024-05589-7,"Center of Excellence in Genomics and Precision Dentistry, Department of Physiology, Faculty of Dentistry, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand.; Center of Excellence in Genomics and Precision Dentistry, Department of Physiology, Faculty of Dentistry, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand.; Dental Faculty, Oral Biology Department, Reference Center of Oral and Dental Rare Diseases, Rothschild Hospital, Université Paris Cité, Paris, France.; Center of Excellence in Genomics and Precision Dentistry, Department of Physiology, Faculty of Dentistry, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand.; Center of Excellence in Genomics and Precision Dentistry, Department of Physiology, Faculty of Dentistry, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand.; Faculty of Dentistry, University of Hong Kong, Hospital Road, Hong Kong, Hong Kong.; Center of Excellence in Genomics and Precision Dentistry, Department of Physiology, Faculty of Dentistry, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, 10330, Thailand. thantrira.p@chula.ac.th.",Humans; Cathepsin C; COVID-19; Animals; Papillon-Lefevre Disease; SARS-CoV-2; Health,66-101 (Health systems research institute); N42A650229 (National Research Council of Thailand),Journal Article; Review
39172335,The emerging role of the gut microbiota and its application in inflammatory bowel disease.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, is a complex disorder with an unknown cause. However, the dysbiosis of the gut microbiome has been found to play a role in IBD etiology, including exacerbated immune responses and defective intestinal barrier integrity. The gut microbiome can also be a potential biomarker for several diseases, including IBD. Currently, conventional treatments targeting pro-inflammatory cytokines and pathways in IBD-associated dysbiosis do not yield effective results. Other therapies that directly target the dysbiotic microbiome for effective outcomes are emerging. We review the role of the gut microbiome in health and IBD and its potential as a diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic target for IBD. This review also explores emerging therapeutic advancements that target gut microbiome-associated alterations in IBD, such as nanoparticle or encapsulation delivery, fecal microbiota transplantation, nutritional therapies, microbiome/probiotic engineering, phage therapy, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), gut proteins, and herbal formulas.","Xiu Wang, Jianhua Peng, Peipei Cai, Yuxuan Xia, Chengxue Yi, Anquan Shang, Francis Atim Akanyibah, Fei Mao",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2024,Diagnosis; Gut microbiome; IBD; Prognosis; Therapy,10.1016/j.biopha.2024.117302,"Key Laboratory of Medical Science and Laboratory Medicine of Jiangsu Province, Department of Laboratory Medicine, School of Medicine, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu 212013, China; Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lianyungang Clinical College, Jiangsu University, Lianyungang, Jiangsu 222006, China.; The People's Hospital of Danyang, Affiliated Danyang Hospital of Nantong University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu 212300, China.; Key Laboratory of Medical Science and Laboratory Medicine of Jiangsu Province, Department of Laboratory Medicine, School of Medicine, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu 212013, China.; Key Laboratory of Medical Science and Laboratory Medicine of Jiangsu Province, Department of Laboratory Medicine, School of Medicine, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu 212013, China.; School of Medical Technology, Zhenjiang College, Zhenjiang 212028, China.; Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lianyungang Clinical College, Jiangsu University, Lianyungang, Jiangsu 222006, China.; Key Laboratory of Medical Science and Laboratory Medicine of Jiangsu Province, Department of Laboratory Medicine, School of Medicine, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu 212013, China.

39166574,Nasal microbiome dynamics: decoding the intricate nexus in the progression of respiratory and neurological diseases.,"In recent times, the nasal region has emerged as a distinctive and dynamic environment where a myriad of microbial communities establish residence from infancy, persisting as both commensal and opportunistic pathogens throughout the lifespan. Understanding the coexistence of microorganisms in respiratory mucosal layers, their potential for infections, and the underlying molecular mechanisms shaping these interactions is crucial for developing efficient diagnostic and therapeutic interventions against respiratory and neurodegenerative diseases. Despite significant strides in understanding the olfactory system's nexus with nasal microbiota, comprehensive correlations with neurological diseases still need to be discovered. The nasal microbiome, a sentinel in immune defense, orchestrates a delicate equilibrium that, when disrupted, can precipitate severe respiratory infections, including Chronic Rhinosinusitis, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), and Asthma, and instigate a cascade effect on central nervous system diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Multiple sclerosis (MS). This review aims to redress this imbalance by meticulously exploring the anatomical and microbiological nuances of the nasal mucosal surface in health and disease. By delineating the molecular intricacies of these interactions, this review unravels the molecular mechanisms that govern the intricate nexus between nasal microbiota dysbiosis, olfactory dysfunction, and the progression of respiratory and neurological diseases.","Keerti Maheshwari, Rashi Gupta, Ruchika Sharma, Amanpreet Kaur, Atul Vashist, Geeta Aggarwal",Critical reviews in microbiology,2024,Human nasal microbiome; neurological disease; nose-brain axis; olfactory system; respiratory disease,10.1080/1040841X.2024.2391488,"Centre for Precision Medicine and Pharmacy, Delhi Pharmaceutical Sciences and Research University, New Delhi, India.; Department of Medical Laboratory Technology, School of Allied Health Sciences, Delhi Pharmaceutical Sciences and Research University, New Delhi, India.; Centre for Precision Medicine and Pharmacy, Delhi Pharmaceutical Sciences and Research University, New Delhi, India.; School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Delhi Pharmaceutical Sciences and Research University, New Delhi, India.; Department of Biotechnology, School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS), Bennett University (The Times Group), Uttar Pradesh, India.; School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Delhi Pharmaceutical Sciences and Research University, New Delhi, India.",N/A,N/A,Journal Article; Review
39166456,Advances in uromodulin biology and potential clinical applications.,"Uromodulin (also known as Tamm-Horsfall protein) is a kidney-specific glycoprotein secreted bidirectionally into urine and into the circulation, and it is the most abundant protein in normal urine. Although the discovery of uromodulin predates modern medicine, its significance in health and disease has been rather enigmatic. Research studies have gradually revealed that uromodulin exists in multiple forms and has important roles in urinary and systemic homeostasis. Most uromodulin in urine is polymerized into highly organized filaments, whereas non-polymeric uromodulin is detected both in urine and in the circulation, and can have distinct roles. The interactions of uromodulin with the immune system, which were initially reported to be a key role of this protein, are now better understood. Moreover, the discovery that uromodulin is associated with a spectrum of kidney diseases, including acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease and autosomal-dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease, has further accelerated investigations into the role of this protein. These discoveries have prompted new questions and ushered in a new era in uromodulin research.

39160319,Couples-based health behavior change interventions: A relationship science perspective on the unique opportunities and challenges to improve dyadic health.,"Epidemiological studies indicate that better marital quality is associated with less morbidity and premature mortality. A number of interpersonal processes related to marital quality are also associated with health-relevant surrogate biomarkers across different physiological systems. Despite these replicated correlational findings, few interventions have harnessed interpersonal processes as potential interventions to enhance health. Building on Dr. Janice Kiecolt-Glaser's model of relationships and health, we propose that couples-based health behavior change interventions may represent an effective way to decrease dysregulation across autonomic, endocrine and immune systems and, ultimately, improve dyadic health. Given that the cohabiting partner is an essential part of the social context in which the behavior change is being pursued, it is important to consider the relational issues triggered by dyadic interventions. Using a relationship science perspective, this article reviews the literature on couples' concordance in health behaviors and health outcomes, the potential pathways underlying this concordance, theories of the couple as a self-sustaining social system, dyadic adaptation of individual self-regulation strategies, effective and ineffective social support and social control in couple relationships, the integration of relationship-building and health behavior change strategies, and the consideration of key moderators related to the nature of the relationship and the context surrounding the relationship. These findings highlight the importance of adopting a relationship science perspective when designing and testing dyadic interventions to improve health outcomes. The data reviewed provide insights on how to optimize couples-based health behavior change interventions to reduce physiological dysregulation and improve dyadic health.","Jean-Philippe Gouin, Maegan Dymarski",Comprehensive psychoneuroendocrinology,2024,N/A,10.1016/j.cpnec.2024.100250,"Department of Psychology, Concordia University, Montreal, Canada.; Department of Psychology, Concordia University, Montreal, Canada.",N/A,N/A,Journal Article
39158906,"Classical apoptotic stimulus, staurosporine, induces lytic inflammatory cell death, PANoptosis.","Innate immunity is the body's first line of defense against disease, and regulated cell death is a central component of this response that balances pathogen clearance and inflammation. Cell death pathways are generally categorized as non-lytic and lytic. While non-lytic apoptosis has been extensively studied in health and disease, lytic cell death pathways are also increasingly implicated in infectious and inflammatory diseases and cancers. Staurosporine (STS) is a well-known inducer of non-lytic apoptosis. However, in this study, we observed that STS also induces lytic cell death at later timepoints. Using biochemical assessments with genetic knockouts, pharmacological inhibitors, and gene silencing, we identified that STS triggered PANoptosis via the caspase-8/RIPK3 axis, which was mediated by RIPK1. PANoptosis is a lytic, innate immune cell death pathway initiated by innate immune sensors and driven by caspases and RIPKs through PANoptosome complexes. Deletion of caspase-8 and RIPK3, core components of the PANoptosome complex, protected against STS-induced lytic cell death. Overall, our study identifies STS as a time-dependent inducer of lytic cell death, PANoptosis. These findings emphasize the importance of understanding trigger- and time-specific activation of distinct cell death pathways to advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of innate immunity and cell death for clinical translation.","Roman Sarkar, Sk Mohiuddin Choudhury, Thirumala-Devi Kanneganti",The Journal of biological chemistry,2024,MLKL; PANoptosis; PANoptosome; RIPK1; RIPK3; apoptosis; caspase; cell death; gasdermin; inflammasome; innate immunity; macrophages; necroptosis; pyroptosis; staurosporine,10.1016/j.jbc.2024.107676,"Department of Immunology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.; Department of Immunology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.; Department of Immunology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.

39158304,Nirsevimab: Alleviating the burden of RSV morbidity in young children.,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of acute lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) and hospital admissions in early childhood. Recent advancements in novel preventive therapies, including extended half-life monoclonal antibodies and antenatal vaccination, have afforded new opportunities to significantly reduce the burden of this infection. Nirsevimab is a novel monoclonal antibody that provides sustained protection against RSV for at least 5 months among newborns and young children. It has received regulatory approval in numerous countries and is being implemented across various settings. Two pivotal Phase 3 trials (MELODY, HARMONIE) demonstrated significant reductions in RSV-associated LRTI hospitalisations following nirsevimab administration, with treatment efficacy of 62.1% and 83.2%. Emerging real-world data from early adopters of nirsevimab corroborates these findings. Studies from Spain, Luxembourg, France and the USA report effectiveness rates between 82% and 90% in preventing RSV-associated hospitalisations among infants entering their first RSV season. Current implementation strategies for nirsevimab have primarily focused on seasonal administration for all infants, aligned to local RSV seasons, and often include catch-up doses for those born before the season begins. Available cost-effectiveness analyses indicate that while nirsevimab offers significant potential public health benefits, its adoption must carefully consider economic factors such as treatment costs, implementation strategies tailored to local viral epidemiology, and logistics for vaccine delivery. Overall, nirsevimab presents a promising opportunity to alleviate the burden of severe RSV infections in young children. However, ongoing surveillance and refinements in implementation strategies are crucial to optimise its impact and ensure sustainability across diverse health-care settings.","Marcus Wing Choy Loe, Helen Soenong, Evelyn Lee, Jean Li-Kim-Moy, Phoebe Cm Williams, Kee Thai Yeo",Journal of paediatrics and child health,2024,child; cost‐effectiveness analysis; monoclonal antibodies; newborn infant; nirsevimab; respiratory syncytial virus infections,10.1111/jpc.16643,"Duke-NUS Medicine School, Singapore.; School of Women's and Children's Health, University of New South Wales, Randwick, New South Wales, Australia.; Centre for Economic Impacts of Genomic Medicine, Macquarie University, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.; National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance, Westmead, New South Wales, Australia.; School of Women's and Children's Health, University of New South Wales, Randwick, New South Wales, Australia.; Duke-NUS Medicine School, Singapore.","Humans; Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections; Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized; Infant; Antiviral Agents; Child, Preschool; Infant, Newborn; Hospitalization",N/A,Journal Article; Review

39155951,Short-chain fatty acid on blood-brain barrier and glial function in ischemic stroke.,"Stroke is the second most common cause of death and one of the most common causes of disability worldwide. The intestine is home to several microorganisms that fulfill essential functions for the natural and physiological functioning of the human body. There is an interaction between the central nervous system (CNS) and the gastrointestinal system that enables bidirectional communication between them, the so-called gut-brain axis. Based on the gut-brain axis, there is evidence of a link between the gut microbiota and the regulation of microglial functions through glial activation. This interaction is partly due to the immunological properties of the microbiota and its connection with the CNS, such that metabolites produced by the microbiota can cross the gut barrier, enter the bloodstream and reach the CNS and significantly affect microglia, astrocytes and other cells of the immune system. Studies addressing the effects of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) on glial function and the BBB in ischemic stroke are still scarce. Therefore, this review aims to stimulate the investigation of these associations, as well as to generate new studies on this topic that can clarify the role of SCFAs after stroke in a more robust manner.","Khiany Mathias, Richard Simon Machado, Solange Stork, Carla Damasio Martins, David Dos Santos, Fabrício Weinheimer Lippert, Josiane Somariva Prophiro, Fabricia Petronilho",Life sciences,2024,Blood-brain barrier; Glial function; Ischemic stroke; Short-chain fatty acid,10.1016/j.lfs.2024.122979,"Laboratory of Experimental Neurology, Graduate Program in Health Sciences, Health Sciences Unit, University of Southern Santa Catarina, Criciuma, SC, Brazil; Program in Health Sciences, Health Sciences Unit, University of South Santa Catarina, Tubarao, SC, Brazil.; Laboratory of Experimental Neurology, Graduate Program in Health Sciences, Health Sciences Unit, University of Southern Santa Catarina, Criciuma, SC, Brazil; Program in Health Sciences, Health Sciences Unit, University of South Santa Catarina, Tubarao, SC, Brazil.; Laboratory of Experimental Neurology, Graduate Program in Health Sciences, Health Sciences Unit, University of Southern Santa Catarina, Criciuma, SC, Brazil; Program in Health Sciences, Health Sciences Unit, University of South Santa Catarina, Tubarao, SC, Brazil.; Laboratory of Experimental Neurology, Graduate Program in Health Sciences, Health Sciences Unit, University of Southern Santa Catarina, Criciuma, SC, Brazil.; Laboratory of Experimental Neurology, Graduate Program in Health Sciences, Health Sciences Unit, University of Southern Santa Catarina, Criciuma, SC, Brazil.; Laboratory of Experimental Neurology, Graduate Program in Health Sciences, Health Sciences Unit, University of Southern Santa Catarina, Criciuma, SC, Brazil.; Program in Health Sciences, Health Sciences Unit, University of South Santa Catarina, Tubarao, SC, Brazil.; Laboratory of Experimental Neurology, Graduate Program in Health Sciences, Health Sciences Unit, University of Southern Santa Catarina, Criciuma, SC, Brazil.

These priorities focus on bacterial and fungal pathogens of crucial importance in addressing AMR, including drug-resistant pathogens causing tuberculosis. These research priorities encompass the entire people-centred journey, covering prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of antimicrobial-resistant infections, in addition to addressing the overarching knowledge gaps in AMR epidemiology, burden and drivers, policies and regulations, and awareness and education. The research priorities were identified through a multistage process, starting with a comprehensive scoping review of knowledge gaps, with expert inputs gathered through a survey and open call. The priority setting involved a rigorous modified Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative approach, ensuring global representation and applicability of the findings. The ultimate goal of this research agenda is to encourage research and investment in the generation of evidence to better understand AMR dynamics and facilitate policy translation for reducing the burden and consequences of AMR.","Silvia Bertagnolio, Zlatina Dobreva, Chad M Centner, Ioana Diana Olaru, Daniele Donà, Stefano Burzo, Benedikt D Huttner, Antoine Chaillon, Nebiat Gebreselassie, Teodora Wi, Mateusz Hasso-Agopsowicz, Benedetta Allegranzi, Hatim Sati, Verica Ivanovska, Kavita U Kothari, Hanan H Balkhy, Alessandro Cassini, Raph L Hamers, Kitty Van Weezenbeek",The Lancet.

Studies have reported both helpful and harmful roles for microglia at the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in the context of disease. However, less is known about microglia-endothelial cell interactions in the healthy brain. To investigate the role of microglia at a healthy BBB, we used the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) inhibitor PLX5622 to deplete microglia and analyzed the BBB ultrastructure, permeability, and transcriptome. Interestingly, we found that, despite their direct contact with endothelial cells, microglia are not necessary for the maintenance of BBB structure, function, or gene expression in the healthy brain.

Dysregulation of innate immunity is hypothesized to be a potent driver of MDS. A recent study revealed increased thrombomodulin (TM) expression on classical monocytes in MDS, which was associated with prolonged survival. TM is a receptor with immunoregulatory capacities, however, its exact role in MDS development remains to be elucidated. In this review we focus on normal monocyte biology and report on the involvement of monocytes in myeloid disease entities with a special focus on MDS. Furthermore, we delve into the current knowledge on TM and its function in monocytes in health and disease and explore the role of TM-expressing monocytes as driver, supporter or epiphenomenon in the MDS bone marrow environment.","Luca L G Janssen, Nathalie van Leeuwen-Kerkhoff, Theresia M Westers, Tanja D de Gruijl, Arjan A van de Loosdrecht",Frontiers in oncology,2024,immune regulation; inflammation; monocytes; myelodysplastic neoplasms (MDS); thrombomodulin (TM),10.3389/fonc.2024.1414102,"Department of Hematology, Amsterdam University Medical Center (UMC), Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, Netherlands.; Department of Hematology, Amsterdam University Medical Center (UMC), Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, Netherlands.; Department of Hematology, Amsterdam University Medical Center (UMC), Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, Netherlands.; Cancer Center Amsterdam, Cancer Biology and Immunology, Amsterdam, Netherlands.; Department of Hematology, Amsterdam University Medical Center (UMC), Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",N/A,N/A,Journal Article; Review

As a naturally occurring hormone and robust antioxidant, accumulating evidence suggests melatonin is a compelling candidate to consider in the context of AD-related pathologies. The review considers several mechanisms, including potential effects on amyloid-beta and pathologic tau burden, antioxidant defense, immune modulation, and regulation of circadian rhythms. Despite its promise, several gaps need to be addressed prior to clinical translation. These include conducting additional randomized clinical trials in patients with or at risk for AD dementia, determining optimal dosage and timing, and further determining potential side effects, particularly of long-term use. This review consolidates existing knowledge, identifies gaps, and suggests directions for future research to better understand the potential of melatonin for neuroprotection and disease mitigation within the landscape of AD.","Zefan Zhang, Pei Xue, Barbara B Bendlin, Henrik Zetterberg, Fernanda De Felice, Xiao Tan, Christian Benedict",Molecular psychiatry,2024,N/A,10.1038/s41380-024-02691-6,"Department of Big Data in Health Science, Zhejiang University School of Public Health and Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.; Department of Pharmaceutical Biosciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.; School of Medicine and Public Health, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA.; Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, the Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg, Mölndal, Sweden.; Centre for Neurosciences Studies, Departments of Biomedical and Molecular Sciences, and Psychiatry, Queen's University, Kingston, ON, K7L 3N6, Canada.; Department of Big Data in Health Science, Zhejiang University School of Public Health and Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China. xiao.tan@zju.edu.cn.; Department of Pharmaceutical Biosciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden. christian.benedict@uu.se.",N/A,N/A,Journal Article; Review
39138203,Cellular translocation and secretion of sialidases.,"Sialidases (or neuraminidases) catalyze the hydrolysis of sialic acid (Sia)-containing molecules, mostly the removal of the terminal Sia on glycans (desialylation) of either glycoproteins or glycolipids. Therefore, sialidases can modulate the functionality of the target glycoprotein or glycolipid and are involved in various biological pathways in health and disease. In mammalian cells, there are four kinds of sialidase, which are Neu1, Neu2, Neu3, and Neu4, based on their subcellular locations and substrate specificities. Neu1 is the lysosomal sialidase, Neu2 is the cytosolic sialidase, Neu3 is the plasma membrane-associated sialidase, and Neu4 is found in the lysosome, mitochondria, and endoplasmic reticulum. In addition to specific subcellular locations, sialidases can translocate to different subcellular localizations within particular cell conditions and stimuli, thereby participating in different cellular functions depending on their loci. Lysosomal sialidase Neu1 can translocate to the cell surface upon cell activation in several cell types, including immune cells, platelets, endothelial cells, and epithelial cells, where it desialylates receptors and thus impacts receptor activation and signaling. On the other hand, cells secrete sialidases upon activation. Secreted sialidases can serve as extracellular sialidases and cause the desialylation of both extracellular glycoproteins or glycolipids and cell surface glycoproteins or glycolipids on their own and other cells, thus playing roles in various biological pathways as well. This review discusses the recent advances and understanding of sialidase translocation in different cells and secretion from different cells under different conditions and their involvement in physiological and pathological pathways.","Majdi A Aljohani, Hiroaki Sasaki, Xue-Long Sun",The Journal of biological chemistry,2024,desialylation; exosome; sialic acid; sialidase; sialylation,10.1016/j.jbc.2024.107671,"Department of Chemistry, Chemical and Biomedical Engineering and Center for Gene Regulation in Health and Disease (GRHD), Cleveland State University, Cleveland, Ohio, USA; Faculty of Applied Medical Sciences, Department of Medical Laboratory Technology, University of Tabuk, Tabuk, Saudi Arabia.; Department of Chemistry, Chemical and Biomedical Engineering and Center for Gene Regulation in Health and Disease (GRHD), Cleveland State University, Cleveland, Ohio, USA; Department of Pharmacognosy and Phytochemistry, Meiji Pharmaceutical University, Kiyose-shi, Tokyo, Japan.; Department of Chemistry, Chemical and Biomedical Engineering and Center for Gene Regulation in Health and Disease (GRHD), Cleveland State University, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.

39128726,The Role of the Gut and Airway Microbiota in Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyps: A Systematic Review.,"In recent years, there has been growing interest in understanding the potential role of microbiota dysbiosis or alterations in the composition and function of human microbiota in the development of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP). This systematic review evaluated the literature on CRSwNP and host microbiota for the last ten years, including mainly nasal bacteria, viruses, and fungi, following the PRISMA guidelines and using the major scientific publication databases. Seventy original papers, mainly from Asia and Europe, met the inclusion criteria, providing a comprehensive overview of the microbiota composition in CRSwNP patients and its implications for inflammatory processes in nasal polyps. This review also explores the potential impact of microbiota-modulating therapies for the CRSwNP treatment. Despite variability in study populations and methodologies, findings suggest that fluctuations in specific taxa abundance and reduced bacterial diversity can be accepted as critical factors influencing the onset or severity of CRSwNP. These microbiota alterations appear to be implicated in triggering cell-mediated immune responses, cytokine cascade changes, and defects in the epithelial barrier. Although further human studies are required, microbiota-modulating strategies could become integral to future combined CRSwNP treatments, complementing current therapies that mainly target inflammatory mediators and potentially improving patient outcomes.","Manuel Gómez-García, Emma Moreno-Jimenez, Natalia Morgado, Asunción García-Sánchez, María Gil-Melcón, Jacqueline Pérez-Pazos, Miguel Estravís, María Isidoro-García, Ignacio Dávila, Catalina Sanz",International journal of molecular sciences,2024,chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps; functional modulation of the microbiota; human microbiota; immune system; respiratory diseases,10.3390/ijms25158223,"Institute for Biomedical Research of Salamanca (IBSAL), 37007 Salamanca, Spain.; Institute for Biomedical Research of Salamanca (IBSAL), 37007 Salamanca, Spain.; Institute for Biomedical Research of Salamanca (IBSAL), 37007 Salamanca, Spain.; Institute for Biomedical Research of Salamanca (IBSAL), 37007 Salamanca, Spain.; Institute for Biomedical Research of Salamanca (IBSAL), 37007 Salamanca, Spain.; Institute for Biomedical Research of Salamanca (IBSAL), 37007 Salamanca, Spain.; Institute for Biomedical Research of Salamanca (IBSAL), 37007 Salamanca, Spain.; Institute for Biomedical Research of Salamanca (IBSAL), 37007 Salamanca, Spain.; Institute for Biomedical Research of Salamanca (IBSAL), 37007 Salamanca, Spain.; Institute for Biomedical Research of Salamanca (IBSAL), 37007 Salamanca, Spain.",Humans; Chronic Disease; Dysbiosis; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Microbiota; Nasal Polyps; Rhinosinusitis,"PI23/00446 (Instituto de Salud Carlos III); PI20/00268 (Instituto de Salud Carlos III); RD21/0002/0054 (Instituto de Salud Carlos III); PMP22/00124 (Instituto de Salud Carlos III); IMP/00009 (Instituto de Salud Carlos III); PID2021-125117OB-I00 (Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades); CD23/00185 (Instituto de Salud Carlos III); FI-21/00048 (Instituto de Salud Carlos III); 2022 C23.I01.P03.S0020-0000205) (European Union)",Systematic Review; Journal Article; Review
39128071,Enhanced Assessment of Cross-Reactive Antigenic Determinants within the Spike Protein.,"Despite successful vaccination efforts, the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants poses ongoing challenges to control COVID-19. Understanding humoral responses regarding SARS-CoV-2 infections and their impact is crucial for developing future vaccines that are effective worldwide. Here, we identified 41 immunodominant linear B-cell epitopes in its spike glycoprotein with an SPOT synthesis peptide array probed with a pool of serum from hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The bioinformatics showed a restricted set of epitopes unique to SARS-CoV-2 compared to other coronavirus family members. Potential crosstalk was also detected with Dengue virus (DENV), which was confirmed by screening individuals infected with DENV before the COVID-19 pandemic in a commercial ELISA for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. A high-resolution evaluation of antibody reactivity against peptides representing epitopes in the spike protein identified ten sequences in the NTD, RBD, and S2 domains. Functionally, antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) in SARS-CoV-2 infections of monocytes was observed in vitro with pre-pandemic Dengue-positive sera. A significant increase in viral load was measured compared to that of the controls, with no detectable neutralization or considerable cell death, suggesting its role in viral entry. Cross-reactivity against peptides from spike proteins was observed for the pre-pandemic sera.

39127450,Fractalkine in Health and Disease.,"CX3CL1 is one of the 50 up-to-date identified and characterized chemokines. While other chemokines are produced as small, secreted proteins, CX3CL1 (fractalkine) is synthetized as a transmembrane protein which also leads to a soluble form produced as a result of proteolytic cleavage. The membrane-bound protein and the soluble forms exhibit different biological functions. While the role of the fractalkine/CX3CR1 signaling axis was described in the nervous system and was also related to the migration of leukocytes to sites of inflammation, its actions are controversial in cancer progression and anti-tumor immunity. In the present review, we first describe the known biology of fractalkine concerning its action through its cognate receptor, but also its role in the activation of different integrins. The second part of this review is dedicated to its role in cancer where we discuss its role in anti-cancer or procarcinogenic activities.","Claudia Rodriguez, Luisa Chocarro, Miriam Echaide, Karina Ausin, David Escors, Grazyna Kochan",International journal of molecular sciences,2024,FKN; Neurotactin; PD-1; PD-L1; T-cell; dendritic cell; immune checkpoint; immunotherapy,10.3390/ijms25158007,"Oncoimmunology Unit, Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria de Navarra (IdiSNA), Navarrabiomed-Fundación Miguel Servet, Universidad Pública de Navarra (UPNA), Hospital Universitario de Navarra (HUN), 31008 Pamplona, Spain.; Oncoimmunology Unit, Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria de Navarra (IdiSNA), Navarrabiomed-Fundación Miguel Servet, Universidad Pública de Navarra (UPNA), Hospital Universitario de Navarra (HUN), 31008 Pamplona, Spain.; Oncoimmunology Unit, Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria de Navarra (IdiSNA), Navarrabiomed-Fundación Miguel Servet, Universidad Pública de Navarra (UPNA), Hospital Universitario de Navarra (HUN), 31008 Pamplona, Spain.; Oncoimmunology Unit, Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria de Navarra (IdiSNA), Navarrabiomed-Fundación Miguel Servet, Universidad Pública de Navarra (UPNA), Hospital Universitario de Navarra (HUN), 31008 Pamplona, Spain.; Oncoimmunology Unit, Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria de Navarra (IdiSNA), Navarrabiomed-Fundación Miguel Servet, Universidad Pública de Navarra (UPNA), Hospital Universitario de Navarra (HUN), 31008 Pamplona, Spain.; Oncoimmunology Unit, Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria de Navarra (IdiSNA), Navarrabiomed-Fundación Miguel Servet, Universidad Pública de Navarra (UPNA), Hospital Universitario de Navarra (HUN), 31008 Pamplona, Spain.",Humans; Chemokine CX3CL1; Neoplasms; Animals; Signal Transduction; Integrins; Inflammation,"FIS PI23/00196 (Instituto de Salud Carlos III-FEDER); FIS PI20/00010 (Instituto de Salud Carlos III-FEDER); BMED 036-2023 (Departamento de Salud del Gobierno de Navarra-FEDER, Spain); LINTERNA, Ref. 0011-1411-2020-000033 (Departamento de Industria, Gobierno de Navarra, Spain); ARNMUNE, 0011-1411-2023-000111 (Departamento de Industria, Gobierno de Navarra, Spain); ISOLDA project, under grant agreement ID: 848166.

39125792,Understanding the influence of social media on COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in a war-torn Syria: A cross-sectional study.,"Social media has become a source of disseminating information to the public during the COVID-19 outbreak which has been a great advantage for healthcare centers. However, foreign anti-vaccination campaigns on social media increased the disbelief in vaccine safety. To our knowledge, the effects of social media on COVID-19 vaccine acceptance are not well-studied in low-income countries. The primary objective of this survey is to investigate Syrians' dependence on social media platforms to get information about vaccines, and to what extent it affects their vaccination decision. A web-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Syria from May 26th to July 26th, 2022 using an online questionnaire as Google Form posted on various social media platforms. The questionnaire consisted of 53 questions related to each of the socio-demographic characteristics, beliefs, and knowledge about COVID-19 vaccination, willingness to get vaccinated, and social media frequency use and its effects. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify factors associated with vaccination behavior. A total of 780 questionnaires were completed; around 42.2% of study participants did not get the vaccine, and 24% would take it only under compulsory rules. Also, only 3.08% of the participants answered correctly on the knowledge-evaluation questions. Results of the univariate analysis showed that being female, living in an urban residential area, and having good vaccine knowledge were positive predictors of vaccine receiving. The unvaccinated group had a higher likelihood of being college students, not trusting in the vaccine, knowing relatively less about the vaccine, and not having previously been exposed to the virus. No significant correlation between vaccination status and using social media was shown in our investigation. However, our results show the importance of social media information in health-related decisions in war-torn countries and emphasize further investigations to confirm causality and determine the best health policy choice.","Areej Kahwaji, Thurya Alaryan, Hani Alhelwani, Moath Salem, Tamim Alsuliman",Medicine,2024,N/A,10.1097/MD.0000000000038956,"Faculty of Pharmacy, Damascus University, Damascus, Syria.; Department of Pharmaceutics and Pharmaceutical Technology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Damascus University, Damascus, Syria.; Hôpital CHU Brugmann, Brussels, Belgium.; Faculty of Medicine, Damascus University, Damascus, Syria.; Sorbonne University, Paris, France.","Humans; Social Media; Syria; Cross-Sectional Studies; Male; COVID-19 Vaccines; Female; Adult; COVID-19; Surveys and Questionnaires; Middle Aged; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Vaccination Hesitancy; Young Adult; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccination; Adolescent",N/A,Journal Article
39125749,Adenosine A2AR in viral immune evasion and therapy: unveiling new avenues for treating COVID-19 and AIDS.,"Adenosine is a neuro- and immunomodulator that functions via G protein-coupled cell surface receptors. Several microbes, including viruses, use the adenosine signaling pathway to escape from host defense systems. Since the recent research developments in its role in health and disease, adenosine and its signaling pathway have attracted attention for targeting to treat many diseases. The therapeutic role of adenosine has been extensively studied for neurological, cardiovascular, and inflammatory disorders and bacterial pathophysiology, but published data on the role of adenosine in viral infections are lacking. Therefore, the purpose of this review article was to explain in detail the therapeutic role of adenosine signaling against viral infections, particularly COVID-19 and HIV. Several therapeutic approaches targeting A2AR-mediated pathways are in development and have shown encouraging results in decreasing the intensity of inflammatory reaction. The hypoxia-adenosinergic mechanism provides protection from inflammation-mediated tissue injury during COVID-19. A2AR expression increased remarkably in CD39 + and CD8 + T cells harvested from HIV patients in comparison to healthy subjects. A combined in vitro treatment performed by blocking PD-1 and CD39/adenosine signaling produced a synergistic outcome in restoring the CD8 + T cells funstion in HIV patients. We suggest that A2AR is an ideal target for pharmacological interventions against viral infections because it reduces inflammation, prevents disease progression, and ultimately improves patient survival.","Muhammad Atif, Abdullah Alsrhani, Farrah Naz, Sajjad Ullah, Abualgasim Elgaili Abdalla, Muhammad Ikram Ullah, Bi Bi Zainab Mazhari, Lienda Bashier Eltayeb, Ismail Hamad, Hasan Ejaz",Molecular biology reports,2024,A2AR; Adenosine; Antiviral therapy; HIV; Immune response; SARS-CoV-2,10.1007/s11033-024-09839-1,"Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, College of Applied Medical Sciences, Jouf University, Sakaka, 72388, Saudi Arabia. maahmad@ju.edu.sa.; Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, College of Applied Medical Sciences, Jouf University, Sakaka, 72388, Saudi Arabia.; Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xian, 710060, China.; University Institute of Medical Laboratory Technology, Faculty of Allied Health Sciences, The University of Lahore, Lahore, 54590, Pakistan.; Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, College of Applied Medical Sciences, Jouf University, Sakaka, 72388, Saudi Arabia.; Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, College of Applied Medical Sciences, Jouf University, Sakaka, 72388, Saudi Arabia.; Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, College of Applied Medical Sciences, Jouf University, Qurayyat, 75911, Saudi Arabia.; Department of Medical Laboratory Sciences, College of Applied Medical Sciences, Prince Sattam Bin AbdulAziz University- Al-Kharj, Riyadh, 11942, Saudi Arabia.; Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, College of Applied Medical Sciences, Jouf University, Sakaka, 72388, Saudi Arabia.; Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, College of Applied Medical Sciences, Jouf University, Sakaka, 72388, Saudi Arabia. hetariq@ju.edu.sa.","Humans; COVID-19; Immune Evasion; Receptor, Adenosine A2A; SARS-CoV-2; Adenosine; Signal Transduction; Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome; COVID-19 Drug Treatment; CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes; Apyrase",N/A,Journal Article; Review
39125711,PTSD biomarkers: Neuroendocrine signaling to epigenetic variants.,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is characterized by exposure to traumatic events and involves symptom domains such as intrusive thoughts, avoidant behaviors, negative mood, and cognitive dysfunction. The disorder can be chronic and debilitating, and the heterogenous nature and varied presentation of PTSD has afforded difficulty in determining efficacious treatment. The ability to identify biomarkers for PTSD risk, prognosis, or for the purposes of treatment, would be highly valuable. There is evidence for peripheral biomarkers related to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, the immune system, neurotransmitters and neurohormones, while genome and epigenome wide association studies have identified genes of interest relating to neurocircuitry, monoaminergic function, and the immune system. Importantly, however, reproducibility is a persistent issue. Considerations for future research include the need for well-powered and well-designed studies to determine directionality, in addition to considering biomarkers as they relate to symptom domains and the spectrum of symptom severity rather than dichotomous diagnostic outcomes. We conclude by recommending the staging of biological processes and PTSD symptoms, from subsyndromal to chronic, which could eventually facilitate selection of personalized treatment interventions for individuals with PTSD, in addition to serving as a future framework for biomarker data.","Alyssa Sbisa, Kristin Graham, Ellie Lawrence-Wood, Alexander C McFarlane, Catherine Toben",Advances in clinical chemistry,2024,Biomarkers; Cortisol; Epigenetic; Genetic; HPA-axis; Neuroinflammation; PTSD,10.1016/bs.acc.2024.06.004,"Phoenix Australia - Centre for Posttraumatic Mental Health, Department of Psychiatry, University of Melbourne, VIC, Australia.

39121327,Do behavioral drivers matter for healthcare decision-making during crises? A study of low-income women in El Salvador during the COVID-19 pandemic.,"Understanding health-seeking behaviors and their drivers is key for governments to manage health policies. A growing body of research explores the role of cognitive biases and heuristics in health and care-seeking behaviors, but little is known about how a context of heightened anxiety and uncertainty might influence these behavioral drivers. This study analyzes the association between four behavioral predictors-internal locus of control, impatience, optimism bias, and aspirations-and healthcare decisions among low-income women in El Salvador, controlling for other factors. We find positive associations between internal locus of control and preventive health behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. For instance, a one standard deviation increase in locus of control is associated with a 10% increase in an index measuring the use of masks, distancing, hand washing, and vaccination. Locus of control was also associated with women's use of preventive health services (one standard deviation improves the likelihood of having a hypertension test in the last six months by 5.8 percentage points). In a sub-sample of mothers, we find significant relationships between the four behavioral drivers and the decisions the mothers make for their children. However, we find these associations are less robust compared to the decisions they make for themselves. Some associations were stronger during the pandemic, suggesting that feelings of uncertainty and stress could amplify behavioral drivers' influence on health-related behaviors. This novel finding is relevant for designing policy responses for future shocks.

While the pathogenesis of this syndrome is still poorly understood, alterations of immune function and the gut microbiota seem to play important roles. Because affected individuals are frequently unable to work for prolonged periods and suffer numerous health compromises, effective treatments represent a major unmet medical need. Multiple potential therapies have been tried, but none is approved yet. Approaches that are able to influence the immune system and gut microbiota such as probiotics and paraprobiotics, i.e., nonviable probiotics, seem promising candidates. We, therefore, evaluated the clinical and immunologic effects of paraprobiotics in a small pilot study.","María José Docampo, Mattei Batruch, Pietro Oldrati, Ernesto Berenjeno-Correa, Marc Hilty, Gabriel Leventhal, Andreas Lutterotti, Roland Martin, Mireia Sospedra",Neurology(R) neuroimmunology & neuroinflammation,2024,N/A,10.1212/NXI.0000000000200296,"From the Neuroimmunology and MS Research (nims) (M.J.D., M.B., P.O., E.B.-C., M.H., A.L., R.M., M.S.), Department of Neurology, University Hospital and University Zurich;

MFGM holds promise as a nutritional supplement because of the numerous physiological functions of its constituent protein. This review summarizes and compares the differences in MFGM protein composition across various species, including bovines, goats, camels, mares, and donkeys, and different lactation periods, such as colostrum and mature milk, as assessed by techniques such as proteomics and mass spectrometry. We also discuss the health benefits of MFGM proteins throughout life. MFGM proteins promote intestinal development, neurodevelopment, and glucose and lipid metabolism by upregulating tight junction protein expression, brain function-related genes, and glucose and fatty acid biosynthesis processes. We focus on the mechanisms underlying these beneficial effects of MFGM proteins. MFGM proteins activate key substances in in signaling pathways, such as the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and myosin light chain kinase signaling pathways. Overall, the consumption of MFGM proteins plays an essential role in conferring health benefits, some of which are important throughout the mammalian life cycle.","Ying Wang, Junrui Wu, Henan Zhang, Xujin Yang, Ruixia Gu, Yumeng Liu, Rina Wu",Critical reviews in food science and nutrition,2024,health benefits; lactations; mammals; mechanism; milk fat globule membrane proteins,10.1080/10408398.2024.2387763,"College of Food Science, Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang, P.R.

39107696,"Moderate BMI accumulation modified associations between blood benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene (BTEX) and phenotypic aging: mediating roles of inflammation and oxidative stress.","The associations between blood benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX) and biological aging among general adults remain elusive. The present study comprised 5780 participants from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2010. A novel measure of biological aging, phenotypic age acceleration (PhenoAge.Accel), derived from biochemical markers was calculated. Weighted generalized linear regression and weighted quantile sum regression (WQS) were utilized to assess the associations between BTEX components and mixed exposure, and PhenoAge.Accel. The mediating roles of systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) and oxidative stress indicators (serum bilirubin and gamma-glutamyl transferase), along with the modifying effects of body mass index (BMI) were also examined. In the single-exposure model, the highest quantile of blood benzene (b = 0.89, 95%CI: 0.58 to 1.20), toluene (b = 0.87, 95%CI: 0.52 to 1.20), and ethylbenzene (b = 0.80, 95%CI: 0.46 to 1.10) was positively associated with PhenoAge.Accel compared to quantile 1. Mixed-exposure analyses revealed a consistent positive association between BTEX mixed exposure and PhenoAge.Accel (b = 0.88, 95%CI: 0.56 to 1.20), primarily driven by benzene (92.78%). The association between BTEX and PhenoAge.Accel was found to be partially mediated by inflammation and oxidative stress indicators (ranging from 3.2% to 13.7%). Additionally, BMI negatively modified the association between BTEX mixed exposure and PhenoAge.Accel, with a threshold identified at 36.2 kg/m^2.

Other attitudes, such as those towards esoteric beliefs, complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), and religion, have also been proposed. However, pertinent studies provide limited direction for public health efforts, as the impact of such attitudes has been tested in isolation or on different outcomes. Moreover, related associations between SARS-CoV-2 immunization drivers as well as views towards other modes of immunization (e.g., routine pediatric immunization), remain unclear. Based on a sample of ~7400 survey participants (Germany), where esoteric belief systems and CAM (Waldorf, homeopathy) are rather prevalent, and controlling for other sociological factors, we found that (i) individuals with positive attitudes towards Waldorf education and homeopathy are significantly less likely to have received a (further) dose of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine compared to those with positive views of mainstream medicine; (ii) for the former, immunization decisions are primarily driven by external pressures, and for the latter overwhelmingly by voluntary considerations; (iii) attitudes influencing adult SARS-CoV-2 vaccine uptake similarly influence views towards routine pediatric immunization.

They generate a B cell receptor with conserved germline characteristics and biased V(D)J recombination, allowing this innate-like lymphocyte to spontaneously produce self-reactive natural antibodies (NAbs) and become activated by immune stimuli in a T cell-independent manner. NAbs were suggested as ""rheostats"" for the chronic diseases in advanced age. In fact, age-dependent loss of function of NAbs has been associated with clinically-relevant diseases in the elderly, such as atherosclerosis and neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we analyzed comprehensively the ontogeny, phenotypic characteristics, functional properties and emerging roles of B-1 cells and NAbs in health and disease. Additionally, after navigating through the complexities of B-1 cell biology from development to aging, therapeutic opportunities in the field are discussed.","Matheus Silvério Mattos, Sofie Vandendriessche, Ari Waisman, Pedro Elias Marques",Immunity & ageing : I & A,2024,Aging; Autoantibodies; B cell development; B-1 cell; Immunology; Natural antibody,10.1186/s12979-024-00455-y,"Laboratory of Molecular Immunology, Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Transplantation, Rega Institute for Medical Research, KU Leuven, 3000, Louvain, Belgium.; Laboratory of Molecular Immunology, Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Transplantation, Rega Institute for Medical Research, KU Leuven, 3000, Louvain, Belgium.; Institute for Molecular Medicine, University Medical Centre of the Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz, Mainz, Germany.; Laboratory of Molecular Immunology, Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Transplantation, Rega Institute for Medical Research, KU Leuven, 3000, Louvain, Belgium. pedro.marques@kuleuven.be.",N/A,N/A,Journal Article; Review
39103038,Arf1 promotes porcine intestinal epithelial cell proliferation via the mTORC1 signaling pathway.,"The promotion of gut health, a pervasive problem in modern animal husbandry, positively affects organismal health, productivity, and economics. Porcine intestinal epithelial cells (IPEC-J2) continuously proliferate to maintain intestinal homeostasis, including barrier, immune, and absorptive functions. Gut homeostasis is fundamental to organismal health. ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (Arf1), a small GTPase, plays a crucial role in coordinating mTORC1 in response to nutrients, especially amino acid availability in the gut. mTORC1 is the central hub of proliferation. Thus, it seems likely that Arf1 promotes IPEC-J2 cell proliferation. However, the exact role of Arf1 in the porcine gut remains unclear. Therefore, we evaluated the functional role and possible mechanisms of Arf1 in the porcine intestine through Arf1 overexpression and knockdown in IPEC-J2 cells. Arf1 overexpression and knockdown significantly enhanced and inhibited, respectively, IPEC-J2 cell viability, and PCNA expression varied with Arf1 expression. Moreover, the proportion of Ki67-positive cells was significantly greater in the Arf1-overexpressing group than in the control group. These results suggest that Arf1 improves IPEC-J2 cell proliferation. The underlying mechanism was explored by Western blotting. Arf1 overexpression and knockdown significantly enhanced and suppressed, respectively, the levels of p-S6K1 and p-RPS6, which are key downstream targets of the mTORC1 signaling pathway. Collectively, our findings reveal the role of the Arf1-mTORC1 axis in IPEC-J2 cell proliferation and its potential function in regulating intestinal homeostasis and health.","Yong-Xia Fang, En-Qing Lu, E Xu, Yi-Yu Zhang, Min Zhu",In vitro cellular & developmental biology.

The basis of neuroimmunology is to understand functional interactions between cells of the immune system and the central nervous system (CNS). These cells communicate across systems because they share signaling molecules and corresponding receptors. Moreover, this cell signaling allows for dynamic bidirectional communication between the immune system and the brain both within the CNS proper as well as across peripheral organs. Because of this, Neuroimmunology intersects with many biological processes including immunity, behavior, endocrinology, metabolism, and pathology. Understanding neuroimmune interactions that influence CNS homeostasis is especially relevant in health and disease. This special issue comprises of 14 articles, representing 9 review articles and 5 original articles, covering the roles of neuroimmunology relevant to CNS injury, CNS & peripheral infections, cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and COVID-19.

39097580,Synthetic hemozoin as a nanocarrier for cross-presentation.,"It is known that conventional antigen presentation involves phagocytosis of antigens followed by its internalization in endocytic compartments and presentation of epitopes through MHC class II molecules for CD4 T cells. However, since 1976 a cross-presentation pathway has been studied, in which CD8 T cells are activated via MHC class I with antigens acquired through phagocytosis or endocytosis by dendritic cells (DCs). Among some important molecules involved in the cross-presentation, the C-type lectin receptor of the Dectin-1 cluster (CLECs), particularly the CLEC9A receptor, not only is expressed in dendritic cells but also presents a pivotal role in this context. In special, CLEC12A has been highlighted as a malaria pigment hemozoin (HZ) receptor. During Plasmodium infection, hemozoin crystals defend the parasite against heme toxicity within erythrocytes, as well as the released native HZ elicits pro-inflammatory responses and can induce cross-presentation. Particularly, this crystal can be synthesized from hematin anhydride and mimics the native form, and the gaps generated between the nanocrystal domains during its synthesis allow for substance coupling followed by its coating. Therefore, this study aimed to assess whether synthetic hemozoin (sHz) or hematin anhydride could be a nanocarrier and promote cross-presentation in dendritic cells. Firstly, it was verified that sHz can carry coated and coupled antigens, the compounds can associate to LAMP1-positive vesicles and decrease overall intracellular pH, which can potentially enhance the cross-presentation of ovalbumin and Leishmania infantum antigens. Thus, this study adds important data in the molecular intricacies of antigen presentation by showing not only the sHz immunomodulatory properties but also its potential applications as an antigen carrier.","Letícia Torres-Dias, Rebeca Santana Souza, Jessica Carolina Alves Moreira, Douglas de Oliveira Paggi, Jônatas Bussador do Amaral, André Luis Lacerda Bachi, Leonardo Augusto, Marina Tiemi Shio",Immunobiology,2024,Hemozoin.

39095816,Advancement in the development of DNA vaccines against Trypanosoma brucei and future perspective.,"Trypanosomes are the extracellular protozoan parasites that cause human African trypanosomiasis disease in humans and nagana disease in animals. Tsetse flies act as a vector for the transmission of the disease in African countries. Animals infected with these parasites become useless or workless, and if not treated, disease can be fatal. There are many side effects associated with old treatments and some of them result in death in 5% of cases. There is a major surface glycoprotein in the parasite known as variant surface glycoprotein. The immune system of the host develops antibodies against this antigen but due to antigenic variation, parasites evade the immune response. Currently, no vaccine is available that provides complete protection. In murine models, only partial protection was observed using certain antigens. In order to develop vaccines against trypanosomes, molecular biology and immunology tools have been used. Immunization is the sole method for the control of disease because the eradication of the vector from endemic areas is an impossible task. Genetic vaccines can carry multiple genes encoding different antigens of the same parasite or different parasites. DNA immunization induces the activation of both cellular immune response and humoral immune response along with the generation of memory. This review highlights the importance of DNA vaccines and advances in the development of DNA vaccines against T. brucei.","Muhammad Tahir Aleem, Furqan Munir, Amna Shakoor, Zia Ud Din Sindhu, Fenfei Gao",International immunopharmacology,2024,Antigenic variation; DNA vaccine; Delivery system; Nanoparticle; T. brucei; Variant surface glycoprotein,10.1016/j.intimp.2024.112847,"Department of Pharmacology, Shantou University Medical College, Shantou 515041, China; Center for Gene Regulation in Health and Disease, Department of Biological, Geological, and Environmental Sciences, College of Sciences and Health Professions, Cleveland State University, Cleveland, OH 44115, USA.

39312599,A unique serum IgG glycosylation signature predicts development of Crohn's disease and is associated with pathogenic antibodies to mannose glycan.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by chronic inflammation in the gut. There is growing evidence in Crohn's disease (CD) of the existence of a preclinical period characterized by immunological changes preceding symptom onset that starts years before diagnosis. Gaining insight into this preclinical phase will allow disease prediction and prevention. Analysis of preclinical serum samples, up to 6 years before IBD diagnosis (from the PREDICTS cohort), revealed the identification of a unique glycosylation signature on circulating antibodies (IgGs) characterized by lower galactosylation levels of the IgG fragment crystallizable (Fc) domain that remained stable until disease diagnosis. This specific IgG2 Fc glycan trait correlated with increased levels of antimicrobial antibodies, specifically anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ASCA), pinpointing a glycome-ASCA hub detected in serum that predates by years the development of CD. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that this agalactosylated glycoform of ASCA IgG, detected in the preclinical phase, elicits a proinflammatory immune pathway through the activation and reprogramming of innate immune cells, such as dendritic cells and natural killer cells, via an FcγR-dependent mechanism, triggering NF-κB and CARD9 signaling and leading to inflammasome activation. This proinflammatory role of ASCA was demonstrated to be dependent on mannose glycan recognition and galactosylation levels in the IgG Fc domain. The pathogenic properties of (anti-mannose) ASCA IgG were validated in vivo. Adoptive transfer of antibodies to mannan (ASCA) to recipient wild-type mice resulted in increased susceptibility to intestinal inflammation that was recovered in recipient FcγR-deficient mice.

39080486,mRNA vaccine design for Epstein-Barr virus: an immunoinformatic approach.,"Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), structurally similar to other herpes viruses, possess significant global health challenges as it causes infectious mononucleosis and is also associated with various cancers. Due to this widespread impact, an effective messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine is paramount to help curb its spread, further underscoring the need for its development. This study, following an immunoinformatic approach, aimed to design a comprehensive mRNA vaccine against the EBV by selecting antigenic proteins, predicting Linear B-cell epitopes, cytotoxic T-cell lymphocyte (CTL) and helper T-cell lymphocyte (HTL) epitopes, and assessing vaccine characteristics. Seventy-nine EBV isolates from diverse geographical regions were examined. Additionally, the vaccine construct's physicochemical properties, transmembrane domains, solubility, and secondary structures were analysed. Molecular docking was conducted with Toll-Like Receptor 5 (TLR-5). Population coverage was assessed for selected major histocompatibility complex (MHC) alleles, and immune response was simulated. The result of this study highlighted a vaccine construct with high antigenicity, non-toxicity, and non-allergenicity and possessed favourable physicochemical properties. The vaccine's 3D structure is native-like and strongly binds with TLR-5, indicating a solid affinity with TLR-5. The selected MHC alleles provided broad universal population coverage of 89.1%, and the immune simulations suggested a robust and wide-ranging immunogenic response, activating critical immune cells, antibodies, and cytokines. These findings provide a solid foundation for further development and testing of the EBV candidate vaccine, offering potential solutions for combating EBV infections.","Elijah Kolawole Oladipo, Temitope Michael Akinleye, Stephen Feranmi Adeyemo, Modinat Wuraola Akinboade, Kehinde Favour Siyanbola, Victoria Ademide Adetunji, Olukayode Abimbola Arowosegbe, Victoria Kehinde Olatunji, Esther Oluwadarasimi Adaramola, Hezekiah Omotayo Afolabi, Christianah Damilola Ajani, Taiwo Pleasure Siyanbola, Elizabeth Oluwatoyin Folakanmi, Boluwatife Ayobami Irewolede, Olalekan John Okesanya, Olumide Faith Ajani, Olumuyiwa Elijah Ariyo, Esther Moradeyo Jimah, Bamidele Abiodun Iwalokun, Olatunji Matthew Kolawole, Julius Kola Oloke, Helen Onyeaka",In silico pharmacology,2024,Cytokines; Epstein–Barr Virus; Immune simulations; Immunoinformatic,10.1007/s40203-024-00244-x,"Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Immunology and Bioinformatics, Department of Microbiology, Adeleke University, Ede, Osun State Nigeria.; Genomics Unit, Helix Biogen Institute, Ogbomosho, Oyo State Nigeria.; Genomics Unit, Helix Biogen Institute, Ogbomosho, Oyo State Nigeria.; Genomics Unit, Helix Biogen Institute, Ogbomosho, Oyo State Nigeria.; Genomics Unit, Helix Biogen Institute, Ogbomosho, Oyo State Nigeria.; Genomics Unit, Helix Biogen Institute, Ogbomosho, Oyo State Nigeria.; Genomics Unit, Helix Biogen Institute, Ogbomosho, Oyo State Nigeria.; Genomics Unit, Helix Biogen Institute, Ogbomosho, Oyo State Nigeria.; Genomics Unit, Helix Biogen Institute, Ogbomosho, Oyo State Nigeria.; Genomics Unit, Helix Biogen Institute, Ogbomosho, Oyo State Nigeria.; Genomics Unit, Helix Biogen Institute, Ogbomosho, Oyo State Nigeria.; Genomics Unit, Helix Biogen Institute, Ogbomosho, Oyo State Nigeria.; Genomics Unit, Helix Biogen Institute, Ogbomosho, Oyo State Nigeria.; Genomics Unit, Helix Biogen Institute, Ogbomosho, Oyo State Nigeria.; Faculty of Medicine, Department of Public Health and Maritime Transport, Laboratory of Hygiene and Epidemiology, University of Thessaly, Papakyriazi 22, Larissa, 41222 Greece.; African Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (African CDC), Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.; Department of Medicine, Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine Unit, Federal Teaching Hospital, Ido-Ekiti, Ekiti State Nigeria.; Genomics Unit, Helix Biogen Institute, Ogbomosho, Oyo State Nigeria.; Molecular Biology and Biotechnology Department, Nigerian Institute of Medical Research, Lagos, Nigeria.; Department of Microbiology, University of Ilorin, Ilorin, 234031 Nigeria.; Department of Natural Science, Precious Cornerstone, Ibadan, 200132 Nigeria.; School of Chemical Engineering, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, Birmingham, B15 2TT UK.",N/A,N/A,Journal Article

39071363,The Central Conserved Peptides of Respiratory Syncytial Virus G Protein Enhance the Immune Response to the RSV F Protein in an Adenovirus Vector Vaccine Candidate.,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a serious human respiratory pathogen that commonly affects children, older adults, and immunocompromised individuals. At present, the design of licensed vaccines focuses on the incorporation of the pre-fusion protein (PreF protein) of RSV, as this protein has the ability to induce antibodies that offer a high level of protection. Moreover, the G protein contains the CX3C motif that binds the chemokine receptor CX3CR1 in respiratory epithelial cells, which plays an essential role in viral infection. Therefore, incorporating the G antigen into vaccine design may prove more advantageous for RSV prevention. In this study, we developed a human adenoviral vector-based RSV vaccine containing highly neutralizing immunogens, a modified full-length PreF protein fused with the central conserved peptides of the G protein (Gcc) from both RSV subgroups trimerized via a C-terminal foldon, and evaluated its immune response in mice through intranasal (i.n.) immunization. Our results showed that immunization with Ad5-PreF-Qa-Gcc elicited a balanced Th1/Th2 immune response and robust mucosal immunity with higher neutralizing antibody titers against RSV Long and RSV B1.

39070930,Patterns of Diversity and Humoral Immunogenicity for HIV-1 Antisense Protein (ASP).,"HIV-1 has an antisense gene overlapping env that encodes the ASP protein. ASP functions are still unknown, but it has been associated with gp120 in the viral envelope and membrane of infected cells, making it a potential target for immune response. Despite this, immune response patterns against ASP are poorly described and can be influenced by the high genetic variability of the env gene. To explore this, we analyzed 100k HIV-1 ASP sequences from the Los Alamos HIV sequence database using phylogenetic, Shannon entropy (Hs), and logo tools to study ASP variability in worldwide and Brazilian sequences from the most prevalent HIV-1 subtypes in Brazil (B, C, and F1). Data obtained in silico guided the design and synthesis of 15-mer overlapping peptides through spot synthesis on cellulose membranes. Peptide arrays were screened to assess IgG and IgM responses in pooled plasma samples from HIV controllers and individuals with acute or recent HIV infection. Excluding regions with low alignment accuracy, several sites with higher variability (Hs > 1.5) were identified among the datasets (25 for worldwide sequences, 20 for Brazilian sequences). Among sites with Hs < 1.5, sequence logos allowed the identification of 23 other sites with subtype-specific signatures. Altogether, amino acid variations with frequencies > 20% in the 48 variable sites identified were included in 92 peptides, divided into 15 sets, representing near full-length ASP. During the immune screening, the strongest responses were observed in three sets, one in the middle and one at the C-terminus of the protein. While some sets presented variations potentially associated with epitope displacement between IgG and IgM targets and subtype-specific signatures appeared to impact the level of response for some peptides, signals of cross-reactivity were observed for some sets despite the presence of B/C/F1 signatures. Our data provides a map of ASP regions preferentially targeted by IgG and IgM responses. Despite B/C/F1 subtype signatures in ASP, the amino acid variation in some areas preferentially targeted by IgM and IgG did not negatively impact the response against regions with higher immunogenicity.","Diogo Gama Caetano, Paloma Napoleão-Pêgo, Larissa Melo Villela, Fernanda Heloise Côrtes, Sandra Wagner Cardoso, Brenda Hoagland, Beatriz Grinsztejn, Valdilea Gonçalves Veloso, Salvatore Giovanni De-Simone, Monick Lindenmeyer Guimarães",Vaccines,2024,ASP; HIV-1; antisense protein; humoral response; subtypes,10.3390/vaccines12070771,"AIDS and Molecular Immunology Laboratory, Oswaldo Cruz Institute, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro 21040-360, Brazil.; Epidemiology and Molecular Systematics Laboratory (LEMS), Oswaldo Cruz Institute, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro 21040-360, Brazil.; Epidemiology and Molecular Systematics Laboratory (LEMS), Oswaldo Cruz Institute, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro 21040-360, Brazil.; AIDS and Molecular Immunology Laboratory, Oswaldo Cruz Institute, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro 21040-360, Brazil.; Instituto Nacional de Infectologia Evandro Chagas, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro 21040-360, Brazil.; Instituto Nacional de Infectologia Evandro Chagas, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro 21040-360, Brazil.; Instituto Nacional de Infectologia Evandro Chagas, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro 21040-360, Brazil.; Instituto Nacional de Infectologia Evandro Chagas, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro 21040-360, Brazil.; Epidemiology and Molecular Systematics Laboratory (LEMS), Oswaldo Cruz Institute, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro 21040-360, Brazil.; AIDS and Molecular Immunology Laboratory, Oswaldo Cruz Institute, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro 21040-360, Brazil.",N/A,UM1 AI069476 (NIAID NIH HHS); E-26/204.446/2021 (Fundação Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro); 152212/2020-5 (National Council for Scientific and Technological Development),Journal Article
39070665,Healthcare Professionals' Perspectives on HPV Recommendations: Themes of Interest to Different Population Groups and Strategies for Approaching Them.,"As a flagship of the Europe's Beating Cancer Plan, the European Commission supports EU member states' efforts to strengthen and expand the routine vaccination of girls and boys against human papillomavirus (HPV). Populations across Europe have grown in diversity, and health systems must adapt to meet the specific needs of increasing diversity. Healthcare professionals (HCPs) must strive to communicate HPV vaccine information in a culturally sensitive manner and address specific concerns related to cultural beliefs, trust in health systems and perceived risks. The objectives of this exploratory study are to identify which themes are most frequently raised during the recommendation of vaccination to minors based on the characteristics of the population (religion, region of origin, gender, level of education and language proficiency) and to collect strategies to improve communication with a diverse population. A survey was distributed through various European public health institutions to HCPs in the region and their networks. The survey included multi-response questions (themes addressed during vaccination recommendation based on population characteristics) and open-ended questions (own qualitative comments and strategies). The most common issues that arise during vaccine recommendation are a lack of knowledge, followed by misinformation. Differences were detected according to the population characteristics. Suggested strategies to improve HPV vaccine recommendation focused on the following aspects: affordability; sexuality and gender; communication platforms; multilingualism; quality of care; school collaboration. HCPs report differences according to the characteristics of the population receiving the recommendation. Personalisation of the recommendations would help to optimise the decision-making process for some groups.","Carlos Murciano-Gamborino, Javier Diez-Domingo, Jaime Fons-Martinez",Vaccines,2024,DEI; HPV vaccination; communication,10.3390/vaccines12070748,"The Foundation for the Promotion of Health and Biomedical Research of Valencia Region (FISABIO), 46020 Valencia, Spain.; The Foundation for the Promotion of Health and Biomedical Research of Valencia Region (FISABIO), 46020 Valencia, Spain.; The Foundation for the Promotion of Health and Biomedical Research of Valencia Region (FISABIO), 46020 Valencia, Spain.",N/A,101080046 (European Commission),Journal Article

39066445,"Neonatal Gut Mycobiome: Immunity, Diversity of Fungal Strains, and Individual and Non-Individual Factors.","The human gastrointestinal ecosystem, or microbiome (comprising the total bacterial genome in an environment), plays a crucial role in influencing host physiology, immune function, metabolism, and the gut-brain axis. While bacteria, fungi, viruses, and archaea are all present in the gastrointestinal ecosystem, research on the human microbiome has predominantly focused on the bacterial component. The colonization of the human intestine by microbes during the first two years of life significantly impacts subsequent composition and diversity, influencing immune system development and long-term health. Early-life exposure to pathogens is crucial for establishing immunological memory and acquired immunity. Factors such as maternal health habits, delivery mode, and breastfeeding duration contribute to gut dysbiosis. Despite fungi's critical role in health, particularly for vulnerable newborns, research on the gut mycobiome in infants and children remains limited. Understanding early-life factors shaping the gut mycobiome and its interactions with other microbial communities is a significant research challenge. This review explores potential factors influencing the gut mycobiome, microbial kingdom interactions, and their connections to health outcomes from childhood to adulthood. We identify gaps in current knowledge and propose future research directions in this complex field.","Alexandra Mpakosi, Rozeta Sokou, Martha Theodoraki, Christiana Kaliouli-Antonopoulou","Life (Basel, Switzerland)",2024,immune system; microbes; microbiome; mycobiome; neonatal fungemia; neonatal infection; neonates,10.3390/life14070902,"Department of Microbiology, General Hospital of Nikaia ""Agios Panteleimon"", 18454 Piraeus, Greece.; Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, General Hospital of Nikaia ""Agios Panteleimon"", 18454 Piraeus, Greece.; Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, General Hospital of Nikaia ""Agios Panteleimon"", 18454 Piraeus, Greece.; Department of Immunology, General Hospital of Nikaia ""Agios Panteleimon"", 18454 Piraeus, Greece.",N/A,N/A,Journal Article; Review

39066386,Gut-Liver-Pancreas Axis Crosstalk in Health and Disease: From the Role of Microbial Metabolites to Innovative Microbiota Manipulating Strategies.,"The functions of the gut are closely related to those of many other organs in the human body. Indeed, the gut microbiota (GM) metabolize several nutrients and compounds that, once released in the bloodstream, can reach distant organs, thus influencing the metabolic and inflammatory tone of the host. The main microbiota-derived metabolites responsible for the modulation of endocrine responses are short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), bile acids and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1). These molecules can (i) regulate the pancreatic hormones (insulin and glucagon), (ii) increase glycogen synthesis in the liver, and (iii) boost energy expenditure, especially in skeletal muscles and brown adipose tissue. In other words, they are critical in maintaining glucose and lipid homeostasis. In GM dysbiosis, the imbalance of microbiota-related products can affect the proper endocrine and metabolic functions, including those related to the gut-liver-pancreas axis (GLPA). In addition, the dysbiosis can contribute to the onset of some diseases such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)/non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and type 2 diabetes (T2D). In this review, we explored the roles of the gut microbiota-derived metabolites and their involvement in onset and progression of these diseases. In addition, we detailed the main microbiota-modulating strategies that could improve the diseases' development by restoring the healthy balance of the GLPA.","Giada Marroncini, Laura Naldi, Serena Martinelli, Amedeo Amedei",Biomedicines,2024,endocrine pathology; gut microbiota; gut–liver–pancreas axis; hormones; metabolites,10.3390/biomedicines12071398,"Department of Experimental and Clinical Biomedical Sciences ""Mario Serio"", University of Florence, 50139 Florence, Italy.; Department of Experimental and Clinical Biomedical Sciences ""Mario Serio"", University of Florence, 50139 Florence, Italy.; Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Florence, 50139 Florence, Italy.; Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Florence, 50139 Florence, Italy.",N/A,"ECS00000017 - CUP B83C22003920001.

39065588,A comprehensive review of synbiotics: an emerging paradigm in health promotion and disease management.,"Synbiotics are complex preparations of prebiotics that can be selectively utilized by live microorganisms to improve host health. Synbiotics are divided into complementary synbiotics, which consist of probiotics and prebiotics with independent functions, and synergistic synbiotics, which consist of prebiotics that are selectively used by gut microorganisms. Complementary synbiotics used in human clinical trials include Lactobacillus spp. and Bifidobacterium spp. as probiotics, and fructooligosaccharides, galactooligosaccharides, and inulin as prebiotics. Over the past five years, synbiotics have been most commonly used in patients with metabolic disorders, including obesity, and immune and gastrointestinal disorders. Several studies have observed alterations in the microbial community; however, these changes did not lead to significant improvements in disease outcomes or biochemical and hematological markers. The same synbiotics have been applied to individuals with different gut environments. As a result, even with the same synbiotics, there are non-responders who do not respond to the applied synbiotics due to the different intestinal environment for each individual. Therefore, to obtain meaningful results, applying different synbiotics depending on the individual is necessary. Synergistic synbiotics are one solution to circumvent this problem, as they combine elements that can effectively improve health, even in non-responders. This review aims to explain the concept of synbiotics, highlight recent human clinical trials, and explore the current state of research on synergistic synbiotics.","Sulhee Lee, Sang-Pil Choi, Hak-Jong Choi, Huijin Jeong, Young-Seo Park",World journal of microbiology & biotechnology,2024,Complementary synbiotics; Human clinical trials; Synbiotics; Synergistic synbiotics,10.1007/s11274-024-04085-w,"Kimchi Functionality Research Group, World Institute of Kimchi, Gwangju, 61755, Republic of Korea.; Kimchi Functionality Research Group, World Institute of Kimchi, Gwangju, 61755, Republic of Korea.; Kimchi Functionality Research Group, World Institute of Kimchi, Gwangju, 61755, Republic of Korea.; Department of Food Science and Biotechnology, Gachon University, Seongnam, 13120, Republic of Korea.; Department of Food Science and Biotechnology, Gachon University, Seongnam, 13120, Republic of Korea. ypark@gachon.ac.kr.",Synbiotics; Humans; Prebiotics; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Probiotics; Health Promotion; Disease Management; Oligosaccharides; Bifidobacterium; Lactobacillus; Obesity; Gastrointestinal Diseases,KE2301-2 (World Institute of Kimchi); KE2301-2 (World Institute of Kimchi); KE2301-2 (World Institute of Kimchi),Journal Article; Review
39063655,Human microglial cells as a therapeutic target in a neurodevelopmental disease model.,"Although microglia are macrophages of the central nervous system, their involvement is not limited to immune functions. The roles of microglia during development in humans remain poorly understood due to limited access to fetal tissue. To understand how microglia can impact human neurodevelopment, the methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MECP2) gene was knocked out in human microglia-like cells (MGLs). Disruption of the MECP2 in MGLs led to transcriptional and functional perturbations, including impaired phagocytosis. The co-culture of healthy MGLs with MECP2-knockout (KO) neurons rescued synaptogenesis defects, suggesting a microglial role in synapse formation. A targeted drug screening identified ADH-503, a CD11b agonist, restored phagocytosis and synapse formation in spheroid-MGL co-cultures, significantly improved disease progression, and increased survival in MeCP2-null mice. These results unveil a MECP2-specific regulation of human microglial phagocytosis and identify a novel therapeutic treatment for MECP2-related conditions.","Pinar Mesci, Christopher N LaRock, Jacob J Jeziorski, Hideyuki Nakashima, Natalia Chermont, Adriano Ferrasa, Roberto H Herai, Tomoka Ozaki, Aurian Saleh, Cedric E Snethlage, Sandra Sanchez, Gabriela Goldberg, Cleber A Trujillo, Kinichi Nakashima, Victor Nizet, Alysson R Muotri",Stem cell reports,2024,ADH-503; CD11b; MECP2; chromatin; iPSC; integrin; microglia; neurodevelopment; neurons; phagocytosis; stem cells; synaptogenesis,10.1016/j.stemcr.2024.06.013,"University of California, San Diego, School of Medicine, Department of Pediatrics/Rady Children's Hospital San Diego, Department of Cellular & Molecular Medicine, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.

39062562,nf-core/airrflow: An adaptive immune receptor repertoire analysis workflow employing the Immcantation framework.,"Adaptive Immune Receptor Repertoire sequencing (AIRR-seq) is a valuable experimental tool to study the immune state in health and following immune challenges such as infectious diseases, (auto)immune diseases, and cancer. Several tools have been developed to reconstruct B cell and T cell receptor sequences from AIRR-seq data and infer B and T cell clonal relationships. However, currently available tools offer limited parallelization across samples, scalability or portability to high-performance computing infrastructures. To address this need, we developed nf-core/airrflow, an end-to-end bulk and single-cell AIRR-seq processing workflow which integrates the Immcantation Framework following BCR and TCR sequencing data analysis best practices. The Immcantation Framework is a comprehensive toolset, which allows the processing of bulk and single-cell AIRR-seq data from raw read processing to clonal inference. nf-core/airrflow is written in Nextflow and is part of the nf-core project, which collects community contributed and curated Nextflow workflows for a wide variety of analysis tasks. We assessed the performance of nf-core/airrflow on simulated sequencing data with sequencing errors and show example results with real datasets. To demonstrate the applicability of nf-core/airrflow to the high-throughput processing of large AIRR-seq datasets, we validated and extended previously reported findings of convergent antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 by analyzing 97 COVID-19 infected individuals and 99 healthy controls, including a mixture of bulk and single-cell sequencing datasets. Using this dataset, we extended the convergence findings to 20 additional subjects, highlighting the applicability of nf-core/airrflow to validate findings in small in-house cohorts with reanalysis of large publicly available AIRR datasets.","Gisela Gabernet, Susanna Marquez, Robert Bjornson, Alexander Peltzer, Hailong Meng, Edel Aron, Noah Y Lee, Cole G Jensen, David Ladd, Mark Polster, Friederike Hanssen, Simon Heumos, Gur Yaari, Markus C Kowarik, Sven Nahnsen, Steven H Kleinstein",PLoS computational biology,2024,N/A,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012265,"Department of Pathology, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, United States of America.; Department of Pathology, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, United States of America.; Yale Center for Research Computing, New Haven, Connecticut, United States of America.; Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma GmbH & Co.

39061972,Conformational Alterations of the Cell Surface of Monomeric and Dimeric β2m-Free HLA-I (Proto-HLA) May Enable Novel Immune Functions in Health and Disease.,"Human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) are polymorphic glycoproteins expressed on the cell surface of nucleated cells and consist of two classes, HLA class I and HLA class II. In contrast, in mice, these molecules, known as H-2, are expressed on both nucleated cells and erythrocytes. HLA-I molecules (Face-1) are heterodimers consisting of a polypeptide heavy chain (HC) and a light chain, B2-microglobulin (B2m). The heterodimers bind to antigenic peptides and present them to the T-cell receptors of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes. The HCs can also independently emerge on the cell surface as B2m-free HC monomers without peptides (Face-2). Early investigators suggested that the occurrence of B2m-free HCs on the cell surface resulted from the dissociation of B2m from Face-1. However, others documented the independent emergence of B2m-free HCs (Face-2) from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the cell surface. The clustering of such HC molecules on either the cell surface or on exosomes resulted in the dimerization of B2m-free HCs to form homodimers (if the same allele, designated as Face-3) or heterodimers (if different alleles, designated as Face-4). Face-2 occurs at low levels on the cell surface of several normal cells but is upregulated on immune cells upon activation by proinflammatory cytokines and other agents such as anti-CD3 antibodies, phytohemagglutinin, and phorbol myristate acetate. Their density on the cell surface remains high as long as the cells remain activated. After activation-induced upregulation, Face-2 molecules undergo homo- and heterodimerization (Face-3 and Face-4). Observations made on the structural patterns of HCs and their dimerization in sharks, fishes, and tetrapod species suggest that the formation of B2m-free HC monomers and dimers is a recapitalization of a phylogenetically conserved event, befitting the term Proto-HLA for the B2m-free HCs. Spontaneous arthritis occurs in HLA-B27+ mice lacking B2m (HLA-B27+ B2m-/-) but not in HLA-B27+ B2m+/+ mice. Anti-HC-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) delay disease development. Some HLA-I polyreactive mAbs (MEM series) used for immunostaining confirm the existence of B2m-free variants in several cancer cells. The conformational alterations that occur in the B2m-free HCs enable them to interact with several inhibitory and activating receptors of cellular components of the innate (natural killer (NK) cells) and adaptive (T and B cells) immune systems. The NK cells express killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs), whereas leukocytes (T and B lymphocytes, monocytes/macrophages, and dendritic cells) express leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptors (LILRs). The KIRs and LILRs include activating and inhibitory members within their respective groups. This review focuses on the interaction of KIRs and LILRs with B2m-free HC monomers and dimers in patients with spondylarthritis. Several investigations reveal that the conformational alterations occurring in the alpha-1 and alpha-2 domains of B2m-free HCs may facilitate immunomodulation by their interaction with KIR and LILR receptors. This opens new avenues to immunotherapy of autoimmune diseases and even human cancers that express B2m-free HCs.","Mepur H Ravindranath, Narendranath M Ravindranath, Carly J Amato-Menker, Fatiha El Hilali, Edward J Filippone",Current issues in molecular biology,2024,beta2-microglobulin; heavy chains; heterodimers; homodimers; human leukocyte antigens; killer immunoglobulin-like receptors; leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptors; monomers; proto-HLA,10.3390/cimb46070416,"Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital, Los Angeles, CA 90027, USA.; Norris Dental Science Center, Herman Ostrow School of Dentistry, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90089, USA.; Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Cell Biology, School of Medicine, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV 26506, USA.; Medico-Surgical, Biomedicine and Infectiology Research Laboratory, The Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy of Laayoune & Agadir, Ibnou Zohr University, Agadir 80000, Morocco.; Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Sidney Kimmel Medical College, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA 19145, USA.",N/A,N/A,Journal Article; Review

Combining these data, we identify cell types and map them to their locations within the tissue. Unbiased deconvolution of the spatial data identifies the following four distinct microenvironments: glomerular, immune, tubule and fibrotic. We describe the complex organization of microenvironments in health and disease and find that the fibrotic microenvironment is able to molecularly classify human kidneys and offers an improved prognosis compared to traditional histopathology.

Recent studies have found that PFAS are not equivalently toxic on all cell types, and that not all cell types exhibit the same sensitivity to individual PFAS. However, immune cells have not been well studied. As immune cells are important for regulating responses to environmental toxins, infection, and cancer, we sought to discover the sensitivity of these cells to various PFAS, including legacy and replacement compounds. We assessed a range of concentrations and found that immune cells are generally more robust when exposed to PFAS, and that Jurkat T-cells were more sensitive than THP-1 monocytes. As monocytes are critical for coordinating inflammatory responses to external threats with cell death cascades, we further investigated these cells. We discovered that THP-1 cells do not undergo organized or programmed death, such as apoptosis or pyroptosis, and instead PFAS exposure results in a more necrotic/lytic and unorganized death, likely contributing to potential inflammatory effects downstream.","Jennifer R McCall, Kathryn T Sausman, Ariel P Brown, Ralph N Mead",Toxicology in vitro : an international journal published in association with BIBRA,2024,Apoptosis; Caspase; Cytotoxicity; Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS),10.1016/j.tiv.2024.105910,"School of Nursing, College of Health and Human Services, University of North Carolina Wilmington, 601 S.

39058741,Circulating innate lymphoid cells (cILCs): Unconventional lymphocytes with hidden talents.,"Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are a group of lymphocytes that are devoid of antigen-specific receptors and are mainly found in tissues. The subtypes ILC1, 2, and 3 mirror T-cell functionality in terms of cytokine production and expression of key transcription factors. Although the majority of ILCs are found in tissue (tILCs), they have also been described within the circulation (cILCs). As a result of their better accessibility and putative prognostic value, human cILCs are getting more and more attention in clinical research. However, cILCs are in many aspects functionally distinct from their tILC counterparts. In fact, from the 3 ILC subsets found within the circulation, only for cILC2s could a clear functional correspondence to their tissue counterparts be established. Indeed, cILC2s are emerging as a major driver of allergic reactions with a particular role in asthma. In contrast, recent studies revealed that cILC1s and cILC3s are predominantly in an immature state and constitute progenitors for natural killer cells and ILCs, respectively. We provide an overview about the phenotype and function of the different cILC subtypes compared to tILCs in health and disease, including transcriptomic signatures, frequency dynamics, and potential clinical value. Furthermore, we will highlight the dynamics of the NKp44","Sabrina B Bennstein, Markus Uhrberg",The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,2024,IBD; ILCs; NK progenitor; allergy; asthma; autoimmune disease; circulation; human; leukemia; progenitor; tissue resident,10.1016/j.jaci.2024.06.016,"Institute for Transplantation Diagnostics and Cell Therapeutics, Medical Faculty and University Hospital Düsseldorf, Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf, Düsseldorf, Germany; Institute of Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.

Ketamine is an effective new therapeutic option for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Its well-established immunomodulatory properties are hypothesized to mediate its antidepressant effect. In this context, higher levels of inflammation may predict a better treatment response. However, conclusive evidence for this hypothesis is lacking. We thus investigated whether standard peripheral inflammatory cell markers and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels could predict symptom improvement during intravenous ketamine therapy in TRD patients.","Bruno Pedraz-Petrozzi, Moritz Spangemacher, Anton Deicher, Lena Drews, Julie Defert, Ana Yaiza Silva-Colmenero, Paul Wein, Elena Riedinger, Gerhard Gründer, Maria Gilles, Alexander Sartorius, Jonathan R Reinwald",Frontiers in psychiatry,2024,immunity; inflammation; ketamine; monocyte; neutrophil; prediction; treatment response; treatment-resistant depression,10.3389/fpsyt.2024.1415505,"Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Central Institute of Mental Health, Medical Faculty Mannheim - University of Heidelberg, Mannheim, Germany.; Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Central Institute of Mental Health, Medical Faculty Mannheim - University of Heidelberg, Mannheim, Germany.; Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Central Institute of Mental Health, Medical Faculty Mannheim - University of Heidelberg, Mannheim, Germany.; Department of Molecular Neuroimaging, Central Institute of Mental Health, Medical Faculty Mannheim - University of Heidelberg, Mannheim, Germany.; Department of Molecular Neuroimaging, Central Institute of Mental Health, Medical Faculty Mannheim - University of Heidelberg, Mannheim, Germany.; Department of Molecular Neuroimaging, Central Institute of Mental Health, Medical Faculty Mannheim - University of Heidelberg, Mannheim, Germany.; Research Group Translational Imaging, Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Central Institute of Mental Health, Medical Faculty Mannheim - University of Heidelberg, Mannheim, Germany.; Research Group Translational Imaging, Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Central Institute of Mental Health, Medical Faculty Mannheim - University of Heidelberg, Mannheim, Germany.; German Centre for Mental Health (Deutsches Zentrum für Psychische Gesundheit, DZPG), Partner Site Heidelberg/Mannheim/Ulm, Mannheim, Germany.; Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Central Institute of Mental Health, Medical Faculty Mannheim - University of Heidelberg, Mannheim, Germany.; Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Central Institute of Mental Health, Medical Faculty Mannheim - University of Heidelberg, Mannheim, Germany.; Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Central Institute of Mental Health, Medical Faculty Mannheim - University of Heidelberg, Mannheim, Germany.",N/A,N/A,Journal Article

We conducted Summary data-based Mendelian randomization analysis by integrating genome-wide association studies data for sepsis with expression quantitative trait locus data, revealing a significant decrease in the expression levels of 17 biomarkers in sepsis patients. Furthermore, based on single-cell RNA sequencing data, we elucidated potential molecular mechanisms at single-cell resolution and identified that LGALS9 inhibition in sepsis patients leads to the activation and differentiation of monocyte and T-cell subtypes.

Thrombin generation potential (TGP) and biomarkers, and blood cellular indices can reflect the underlying pathophysiology and risk stratification of PE. This case-control study analyzed TGP in 209 PE patients from Loyola University, Pulmonary Embolism Response Team program compared to normal human plasma (NHP) controls. The present study evaluates TGP and biomarkers, and cellular indices in relation to PE severity, according to the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines. Statistical analysis including median with interquartile range (IQR), 2-tailed Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney test, Chi-square test, and Spearman Correlational analysis were performed. There were 209 patients with PE, with an almost equal distribution between sex, and a median age of 63 years. Significant downregulation in peak thrombin and endogenous thrombin potential (ETP), as well as upregulation in lag time, were observed in PE patients versus controls. Biomarker analysis revealed pronounced elevations, with D-dimer demonstrating the most significant increase. Blood cellular indices also rose in PE patients, correlating with disease severity. PE severity was associated with higher TGP and biomarker levels. Mortality rates differed significantly across risk categories and were highest in patients with elevated cellular indices. TGP and biomarkers are intricately linked to PE severity and can aid in risk stratification. Elevated cellular indices are associated with increased mortality, highlighting their potential as prognostic markers. These findings could enhance the precision of PE management strategies.","Fakiha Siddiqui, Alfonso Tafur, Amir Darki, Bulent Kantarcioglu, Debra Hoppensteadt, Emily Krupa, Omer Iqbal, Jawed Fareed, Manuel Monreal",Clinical and applied thrombosis/hemostasis : official journal of the International Academy of Clinical and Applied Thrombosis/Hemostasis,2024,D-dimer; NLR*platelets); neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR); platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR); prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 (F1+2); systemic immune-inflammation index (SII; thrombin–antithrombin complex (TAT),10.1177/10760296241261076,"PhD Program in Health Sciences, UCAM - Universidad Católica San Antonio de Murcia, Murcia, Spain.; Department of Medicine and Vascular Medicine, Evanston NorthShore University Health System, Evanston, Illinois, USA.; Department of Cardiology, Health Science Division, Cardiovascular Research Institute, Loyola University Chicago, Maywood, Illinois, USA.; Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, Cardiovascular Research Institute, Health Science Division, Loyola University Chicago, Maywood, Illinois, USA.; Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, and Department of Pharmacology and Neuroscience, Health Science Division, Cardiovascular Research Institute, Loyola University Chicago, Maywood, Illinois, USA.; Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, Cardiovascular Research Institute, Health Science Division, Loyola University Chicago, Maywood, Illinois, USA.; Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, Cardiovascular Research Institute, Health Science Division, Loyola University Chicago, Maywood, Illinois, USA.; Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, and Department of Pharmacology and Neuroscience, Health Science Division, Cardiovascular Research Institute, Loyola University Chicago, Maywood, Illinois, USA.; Department of Internal Medicine, Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol, Badalona, Barcelona, Spain.",Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Biomarkers; Case-Control Studies; Pulmonary Embolism; Thrombin,N/A,Journal Article

The gingiva, defined as the mucosal barrier that surrounds and supports the teeth, is the only barrier site completely transected by a hard structure, the tooth. The tissue is damaged in early life during tooth eruption and chronically throughout life by the process of mastication. This occurs alongside challenges typical of barrier sites, including exposure to invading pathogens, the local commensal microbial community and environmental antigens. This review will focus on the immune network safeguarding gingival integrity, which is far less understood than that resident at other barrier sites. A detailed understanding of the gingiva-resident immune network is vital as it is the site of the inflammatory disease periodontitis, the most common chronic inflammatory condition in humans which has well-known detrimental systemic effects. Furthering our understanding of how the immune populations within the gingiva develop, are tailored in health, and how this is dysregulated in disease would further the development of effective therapies for periodontitis.","Joanne E Konkel, Joshua R Cox, Kelly Wemyss",Mucosal immunology,2024,B cells; Gingiva; Macrophages; Microbiota; Monocytes; Neutrophils; Periodontitis; T cells,10.1016/j.mucimm.2024.07.004,"Lydia Becker Institute of Immunology and Inflammation, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.

39042726,"Generation and Characterization of hiPSC-Derived Vascularized-, Perfusable Cardiac Microtissues-on-Chip.","In the heart in vivo, vasculature forms a semi-permeable endothelial barrier for selective nutrient and (immune) cell delivery to the myocardium and removal of waste products. Crosstalk between the vasculature and the heart cells regulates homeostasis in health and disease. To model heart development and disease in vitro it is important that essential features of this crosstalk are captured. Cardiac organoid and microtissue models often integrate endothelial cells (ECs) to form microvascular networks inside the 3D structure. However, in static culture without perfusion, these networks may fail to show essential functionality. Here, we describe a protocol to generate an in vitro model of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived vascularized cardiac microtissues on a microfluidic organ-on-chip platform (VMToC) in which the blood vessels are perfusable. First, prevascularized cardiac microtissues (MT) are formed by combining hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes, ECs, and cardiac fibroblasts in a pre-defined ratio. Next, these prevascularized MTs are integrated in the chips in a fibrin hydrogel containing additional vascular cells, which self-organize into tubular structures. The MTs become vascularized through anastomosis between the pre-existing microvasculature in the MT and the external vascular network. The VMToCs are then ready for downstream structural and functional assays and basic characterization. Using this protocol, cardiac MTs can be efficiently and robustly vascularized and perfused within 7 days. In vitro vascularized organoid and MT models have the potential to transition current 3D cardiac models to more physiologically relevant organ models that allow the role of the endothelial barrier in drug and inflammatory response to be investigated. © 2024 The Author(s).

We leverage in silico tools to investigate whether the occurrence of mutations in proteins previously described as immunogenic and highly expressed by glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), such as Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), Isocitrate Dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1), Phosphatase and Tensin homolog (PTEN) and Tumor Protein 53 (TP53), may be contributing to the differential presentation of immunogenic epitopes. We recovered Class I MHC binding information from wild-type and mutated proteins using the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB). After that, we built peptide-MHC (pMHC-I) models in HLA-arena, followed by hierarchical clustering analysis based on electrostatic surface features from each complex. We identified point mutations that are determinants for the presentation of a set of peptides from TP53 protein. We point to structural features in the pMHC-I complexes of wild-type and mutated peptides, which may play a role in the recognition of CD8 T cells. To further explore these features, we performed 100 ns molecular dynamics simulations for the peptide pairs (wt/mut) selected. In pursuit of novel therapeutic targets for GBM treatment, we selected peptides where our predictive results indicated that mutations would not disrupt epitope presentation, thereby maintaining a specific CD8 T cell immune response.

39040104,Lymphatic-localized Treg-mregDC crosstalk limits antigen trafficking and restrains anti-tumor immunity.,"The tumor microenvironment (TME) has a significant impact on tumor growth and immunotherapy efficacies. However, the precise cellular interactions and spatial organizations within the TME that drive these effects remain elusive. Using advanced multiplex imaging techniques, we have discovered that regulatory T cells (Tregs) accumulate around lymphatic vessels in the peripheral tumor stroma. This localized accumulation is facilitated by mature dendritic cells enriched in immunoregulatory molecules (mregDCs), which promote chemotaxis of Tregs, establishing a peri-lymphatic Treg-mregDC niche. Within this niche, mregDCs facilitate Treg activation, which in turn restrains the trafficking of tumor antigens to the draining mesenteric lymph nodes, thereby impeding the initiation of anti-tumor adaptive immune responses. Disrupting Treg recruitment to mregDCs inhibits tumor progression. Our study provides valuable insights into the organization of TME and how local crosstalk between lymphoid and myeloid cells suppresses anti-tumor immune responses.","Siyuan You, Shuqin Li, Lingsu Zeng, Jinsheng Song, Zifeng Li, Weiyun Li, Hengxiao Ni, Xu Xiao, Wenbo Deng, Hongye Li, Wenbo Lin, Chenyu Liang, Yanfei Zheng, Shih-Chin Cheng, Nengming Xiao, Mengsha Tong, Rongshan Yu, Jialiang Huang, Hongling Huang, Hongzhi Xu, Jiahuai Han, Jianlin Ren, Kairui Mao",Cancer cell,2024,antigen trafficking;

39022334,The health risk of social disadvantage is transplantable into a new host.,"Low socioeconomic status (SES) is a risk factor for mortality and immune dysfunction across a wide range of diseases, including cancer. However, cancer is distinct in the use of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) as a treatment for hematologic malignancies to transfer healthy hematopoietic cells from one person to another. This raises the question of whether social disadvantage of an HCT cell donor, as assessed by low SES, might impact the subsequent health outcomes of the HCT recipient. To evaluate the cellular transplantability of SES-associated health risk, we analyzed the health outcomes of 2,005 HCT recipients who were transplanted for hematologic malignancy at 125 United States transplant centers and tested whether their outcomes differed as a function of their cell donor's SES (controlling for other known HCT-related risk factors). Recipients transplanted with cells from donors in the lowest quartile of SES experienced a 9.7% reduction in overall survival (","Lucie M Turcotte, Tao Wang, Kirsten M Beyer, Steven W Cole, Stephen R Spellman, Mariam Allbee-Johnson, Eric Williams, Yuhong Zhou, Michael R Verneris, J Douglas Rizzo, Jennifer M Knight",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2024,allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation; disparities; health outcomes; social determinants of health; socioeconomic status,10.1073/pnas.2404108121,"Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis, MN 55455.; Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI 53226.; Division of Epidemiology and Social Sciences, Institute for Health and Equity, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI 53226.; Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095.; Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, National Marrow Donor Program/Be the Match, Minneapolis, MN 55401.; Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI 53226.; Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, National Marrow Donor Program/Be the Match, Minneapolis, MN 55401.; Division of Epidemiology and Social Sciences, Institute for Health and Equity, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI 53226.; Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado-Denver, Denver, CO 80045.; Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI 53226.; Department of Psychiatry and Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI 53226.",Humans; Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Adult; Hematologic Neoplasms; Risk Factors; Social Class; United States; Aged; Adolescent; Tissue Donors,R01 CA23856 (HHS | NIH | National Cancer Institute (NCI)),Journal Article

39018340,Autophagy as a Therapeutic Target in Breast Tumors: The Cancer stem cell perspective.,"Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease, with a subpopulation of tumor cells known as breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) with self-renewal and differentiation abilities that play a critical role in tumor initiation, progression, and therapy resistance. The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a complex area where diverse cancer cells reside creating a highly interactive environment with secreted factors, and the extracellular matrix. Autophagy, a cellular self-digestion process, influences dynamic cellular processes in the tumor TME integrating diverse signals that regulate tumor development and heterogeneity. Autophagy acts as a double-edged sword in the breast TME, with both tumor-promoting and tumor-suppressing roles. Autophagy promotes breast tumorigenesis by regulating tumor cell survival, migration and invasion, metabolic reprogramming, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). BCSCs harness autophagy to maintain stemness properties, evade immune surveillance, and resist therapeutic interventions. Conversely, excessive, or dysregulated autophagy may lead to BCSC differentiation or cell death, offering a potential avenue for therapeutic exploration. The molecular mechanisms that regulate autophagy in BCSCs including the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), AMPK, and Beclin-1 signaling pathways may be potential targets for pharmacological intervention in breast cancer. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the relationship between autophagy and BCSCs, highlighting recent advancements in our understanding of their interplay. We also discuss the current state of autophagy-targeting agents and their preclinical and clinical development in BCSCs.","Sana Raza, Jawed Akhtar Siddiqui, Anubhav Srivastava, Naibedya Chattopadhyay, Rohit Anthony Sinha, Bandana Chakravarti",Autophagy reports,2024,Autophagy; Breast Cancer; Breast Cancer stem cells; Metabolism; Tumor microenvironment,10.1080/27694127.2024.2358648,"Department of Endocrinology, Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow 226014, India.; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE-68198, USA.; Department of Molecular Medicine & Biotechnology, Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow 226014, India.; Division of Endocrinology and Center for Research in Anabolic Skeletal Target in Health and Illness (ASTHI), CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, Sector 10, Jankipuram Extension, Sitapur Road, Lucknow, 226031, India.; Department of Endocrinology, Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow 226014, India.; Department of Endocrinology, Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow 226014, India.",N/A,N/A,Journal Article

Recently, knowledge on the role of PTP1B as a major regulator of multiple signalling pathways involved in cell growth, proliferation, viability and metabolism has expanded, and PTP1B is recognised as a therapeutic target in several human disorders, including diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular diseases and hematopoietic malignancies. The function of PTP1B in the immune system was largely overlooked until it was discovered that PTP1B negatively regulates the Janus kinase-a signal transducer and activator of the transcription (JAK/STAT) signalling pathway, which plays a significant role in modulating immune responses. PTP1B is now known to determine the magnitude of many signalling pathways that drive immune cell activation and function. As such, PTP1B inhibitors are being developed and tested in the context of inflammation and autoimmune diseases. Here, we provide an up-to-date summary of the molecular role of PTP1B in regulating immune cell function and how targeting its expression and/or activity has the potential to change the outcomes of immune-mediated and inflammatory disorders.","Neve E Read, Heather M Wilson",International journal of molecular sciences,2024,disease; haematopoiesis; immune cells; inflammation; protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B); signalling,10.3390/ijms25137207,"Institute of Medical Sciences, School of Medicine, Medical Sciences and Nutrition, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen AB25 2ZD, UK.; Institute of Medical Sciences, School of Medicine, Medical Sciences and Nutrition, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen AB25 2ZD, UK.","Humans; Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 1; Signal Transduction; Animals; Inflammation; Diabetes Mellitus","RG16164 (Cancer PhD program, University of Aberdeen)",Journal Article; Review
39008669,Techniques for evaluating the ATP-gated ion channel P2X7 receptor function in macrophages and microglial cells.,"Resident macrophages are tissue-specific innate immune cells acting as sentinels, constantly patrolling their assigned tissue to maintain homeostasis, and quickly responding to pathogenic invaders or molecular danger signals molecules when necessary. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP), when released to the extracellular medium, acts as a danger signal through specific purinergic receptors. Interaction of ATP with the purinergic receptor P2X7 activates macrophages and microglial cells in different pathological conditions, triggering inflammation. The highly expressed P2X7 receptor in these cells induces cell membrane permeabilization, inflammasome activation, cell death, and the production of inflammatory mediators, including cytokines and nitrogen and oxygen-reactive species. This review explores the techniques to evaluate the functional and molecular aspects of the P2X7 receptor, particularly in macrophages and microglial cells. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Western blotting, and immunocytochemistry or immunohistochemistry are essential for assessing gene and protein expression in these cell types. Evaluation of P2X7 receptor function involves the use of ATP and selective agonists and antagonists and diverse techniques, including electrophysiology, intracellular calcium measurements, ethidium bromide uptake, and propidium iodide cell viability assays. These techniques are crucial for studying the role of P2X7 receptors in immune responses, neuroinflammation, and various pathological conditions.

39007437,A quadrivalent norovirus vaccine based on a chimpanzee adenovirus vector induces potent immunity in mice.,"Norovirus (NoV) infection is a major cause of gastroenteritis worldwide. The virus poses great challenges in developing vaccines with broad immune protection due to its genetic and antigenic diversity. To date, there are no approved NoV vaccines for clinical use. Here, we aimed to develop a broad-acting quadrivalent NoV vaccine based on a chimpanzee adenovirus vector, AdC68, carrying the major capsid protein (VP1) of noroviral GI and GII genotypes. Compared to intramuscular (i.m.), intranasal (i.n.), or other prime-boost immunization regimens (i.m. ​+ ​i.m., i.m. ​+ ​i.n., i.n. ​+ ​i.m.), AdC68-GI.1-GII.3 (E1)-GII.4-GII.17 (E3), administered via i.n. ​+ ​i.n. induced higher titers of serum IgG antibodies and higher IgA antibodies in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and saliva against the four homologous VP1s in mice. It also significantly stimulated the production of blocking antibodies against the four genotypes. In response to re-stimulation with virus-like particles (VLP)-GI.1, VLP-GII.3, VLP-GII.4, and VLP-GII.17, the quadrivalent vaccine administered according to the i.n. ​+ ​i.n. regimen effectively triggered specific cell-mediated immune responses, primarily characterized by IFN-γ secretion. Furthermore, the preparation of this novel quadrivalent NoV vaccine requires only a single recombinant adenovirus to provide broad preventive immunity against the major GI/GII epidemic strains, making it a promising vaccine candidate for further development.","Yihua Jiang, Lingjin Sun, Nan Qiao, Xiang Wang, Caihong Zhu, Man Xing, Hui Liu, Ping Zhou, Dongming Zhou",Virologica Sinica,2024,Adenovirus vector; Norovirus (NoV); Quadrivalent vaccine,10.1016/j.virs.2024.07.002,"Department of Pathogen Biology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, 300070, China.; Department of Pathogen Biology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, 300070, China.; Department of Pathogen Biology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, 300070, China.; Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University, Shanghai, 201508, China.; Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University, Shanghai, 201508, China.; Department of Pathogen Biology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, 300070, China; Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University, Shanghai, 201508, China.; R&D Centre, Chengdu Kanghua Biological Products Co., Ltd, Chengdu, 610000, China.

However, it shows a deficit in targeting naïve B cells in vitro. In this study, we investigated whether α-IgM can support ODN2006-induced effects on B cells to obtain enhanced activation with focus on different B cell subsets. Our results delineated robust B cell activation, shown by increased activation marker expression and cytokine secretion by each agent alone, and further augmented when used in combination. Interestingly, α-IgM targeted mainly naïve and marginal zone-like B cells, thus complementing the pronounced effects of ODN2006 on memory B cells and achieving optimal activation for all B cell subsets. Taken together, combining ODN2006 and α-IgM is beneficial for in vitro activation including all B cell subsets. Furthermore, our results suggest that α-IgM could enhance efficacy of ODN2006 in vivo with further need of investigation.","Leonie Fleige, Simon Fillatreau, Maren Claus, Silvia Capellino",Cellular immunology,2024,Activation; B cells; CpG ODN2006; Cytokine secretion; Memory; Naïve; α-IgM,10.1016/j.cellimm.2024.104846,"Department of Immunology, Research Group of Neuroimmunology, IfADo-Leibniz Research Centre for Working Environment and Human Factors, Ardeystraße 67, 44139 Dortmund, Germany.

Methods used for sampling (drain aspirate vs swab from top of drain) and detection of CPOs in clinical HWB drains in two different healthcare settings, one which was dealing with a hospital-wide CPO outbreak (Hospital A) and another with no reported outbreaks (Hospital B), were compared. Drain aspirates and swabs from HWB drains were tested using multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) together with culture-based methods. No significant difference in detection of CPOs was found between drain aspirate or swab methods of sampling. Direct PCR on samples detected significantly more carbapenemase genes than culture on CARBA agar (P<0.0001 and 0.0045, respectively). A higher percentage of HWB drains were positive in Hospital A both by culture and by direct PCR, and a significantly higher number of carbapenemase genes were detected in HWB drain aspirates at Hospital A, both by PCR and by culture (P=0.014 and 0.0071, respectively). There was high correlation between drain swab positivity by PCR and culture in Hospital A (91%) compared with Hospital B (33%). No difference in drain contamination rates was found when HWBs with a rear drain were compared with HWBs with the drain directly below the tap. Colonization of HWBs at the top of the drain may be related to risk of cross-transmission of CPOs from the healthcare environment to patients.","M Meda, M M Sagair, M Weinbren, C Wells, S Ezie, M Navarro, S Cherupuzhathottathil, C Nagy, M Fortes-Aguila, N Da Silva Martins, V Gentry",The Journal of hospital infection,2024,CPE in hospital handwash basins; Clinical handwash basin Carbapenemase-producing organism detection; Drain sampling,10.1016/j.jhin.2024.06.008,"Department of Infection and Immunity, Frimley Health NHS Foundation Trust, Frimley, UK; Department of Infection Prevention and Control, Frimley Health NHS Foundation Trust, Frimley, UK.

38990375,Intracellular galectin interactions in health and disease.,"In the galectin family, a group of lectins is united by their evolutionarily conserved carbohydrate recognition domains. These polypeptides play a role in various cellular processes and are implicated in disease mechanisms such as cancer, fibrosis, infection, and inflammation. Following synthesis in the cytosol, manifold interactions of galectins have been described both extracellularly and intracellularly. Extracellular galectins frequently engage with glycoproteins or glycolipids in a carbohydrate-dependent manner. Intracellularly, galectins bind to non-glycosylated proteins situated in distinct cellular compartments, each with multiple cellular functions. This diversity complicates attempts to form a comprehensive understanding of the role of galectin molecules within the cell. This review enumerates intracellular galectin interaction partners and outlines their involvement in cellular processes. The intricate connections between galectin functions and pathomechanisms are illustrated through discussions of intracellular galectin assemblies in immune and cancer cells. This underscores the imperative need to fully comprehend the interplay of galectins with the cellular machinery and to devise therapeutic strategies aimed at counteracting the establishment of galectin-based disease mechanisms.","Ralf Jacob, Lena-Sophie Gorek",Seminars in immunopathology,2024,Cancer; Galectin; Immune cell; Protein interaction,10.1007/s00281-024-01010-z,"Department of Cell Biology and Cell Pathology, Philipps University of Marburg, Karl-von-Frisch-Str. 14, D-35043, Marburg, Germany. jacob@staff.uni-marburg.de.; Department of Cell Biology and Cell Pathology, Philipps University of Marburg, Karl-von-Frisch-Str. 14, D-35043, Marburg, Germany.",Humans; Galectins; Animals; Neoplasms; Protein Binding; Disease Susceptibility; Inflammation; Intracellular Space,N/A,Journal Article; Review
38989970,Toll-like receptor 13-mediated signaling protects against the development of colon cancer.,"Appropriate host-microbiota interactions are essential for maintaining intestinal homeostasis; hence, an imbalance in these interactions leads to inflammation-associated intestinal diseases. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognize microbial ligands and play a key role in host-microbe interactions in health and disease. TLR13 has a well-established function in enhancing host defenses against pathogenic bacteria. However, its role in maintaining intestinal homeostasis and controlling colitis-associated colon cancer (CAC) is largely unknown. This study aimed to investigate the involvement of TLR13-mediated signaling in intestinal homeostasis and colonic tumorigenesis using ex vivo cell and in vivo CAC animal model. Tlr13-deficient mice were prone to dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis. During the early stages of the CAC regimen (AOM/DSS-treated), Tlr13 deficiency led to severe ulcerative colitis. Moreover, Tlr13-deficient mice exhibited increased intestinal permeability, as evidenced by elevated levels of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran, endotoxins, and bacterial translocation. Enhanced cell survival and proliferation of colonic intestinal cells were observed in Tlr13-deficient mice. A transcriptome analysis revealed that Tlr13 deficiency is associated with substantial changes in gene expression profile of colonic tumor tissue. Tlr13-deficient mice were more susceptible to CAC, with increased production of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-12, and TNF-α cytokines and enhanced STAT3, NF-κB, and MAPK signaling in colon tissues. These findings suggest that TLR13 plays a protective role in maintaining intestinal homeostasis and controlling CAC. Our study provides a novel perspective on intestinal health via TLR13-mediated signaling, which is crucial for deciphering the role of host-microbiota interactions in health and disease.","Asma Rafique, Irshad Ali, Seukchan Kim, Adeel Farooq, Umar Manzoor, Jeungho Moon, Madeeha Arooj, Meejung Ahn, Youngjun Park, Chang Lim Hyun, Young-Sang Koh",International journal of cancer,2024,STAT3 signaling; colitis‐associated colon cancer; intestinal homeostasis; toll‐like receptor 13,10.1002/ijc.35089,"College of Medicine, and Jeju Research Center for Natural Medicine, Jeju National University, Jeju, South Korea.; College of Medicine, and Jeju Research Center for Natural Medicine, Jeju National University, Jeju, South Korea.; Department of Animal Science, College of Life Science, Sangji University, Wonju, South Korea.; Research Institute for Basic Sciences, Jeju National University, Jeju, South Korea.; Interdisciplinary Graduate Program in Advanced Convergence Technology and Science, Jeju National University, Jeju, South Korea.; Department of Animal Science, College of Life Science, Sangji University, Wonju, South Korea.; College of Medicine, and Jeju Research Center for Natural Medicine, Jeju National University, Jeju, South Korea.; Department of Animal Science, College of Life Science, Sangji University, Wonju, South Korea.; Interdisciplinary Graduate Program in Advanced Convergence Technology and Science, Jeju National University, Jeju, South Korea.; College of Medicine, and Jeju Research Center for Natural Medicine, Jeju National University, Jeju, South Korea.; College of Medicine, and Jeju Research Center for Natural Medicine, Jeju National University, Jeju, South Korea.","Animals; Mice; Signal Transduction; Dextran Sulfate; Colonic Neoplasms; Mice, Knockout; Colitis-Associated Neoplasms; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Humans; Disease Models, Animal; Toll-Like Receptors; Male",NRF-2019R1A2C1008275 (National Research Foundation of Korea); RS-2023-00270936 (National Research Foundation of Korea),Journal Article
38985733,"Navigating vaccination choices: The intersecting dynamics of institutional trust, belonging and message perception among Congolese migrants in London, UK (a reflexive thematic analysis).","The COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately impacted intersectionally marginalised migrants, revealing systemic disparities in health outcomes and vaccine uptake. Understanding the underlying social and structural factors influencing health behaviours is necessary to develop tailored interventions for migrants, but these factors have been seldom explored. This qualitative study aimed to explore contextual factors shaping COVID-19 vaccination decision-making among Congolese migrants in the UK.A community-based participatory research study was designed and led by a community-academic partnership in London, UK (2021-2022). Peer-led, semi-structured interviews were conducted in Lingala with 32 adult Congolese migrants and explored beliefs, perceptions and lived experiences of migration, healthcare, vaccination and the COVID-19 pandemic. Reflexive thematic analysis generated two themes and a model conceptualising the vaccination decision-making process. Participants and community partners were financially compensated; ethics was granted by the University of London ethics committee (REC: 2021.0128).Participants highlighted the incompatibility of lockdown restrictions with their communal culture, which intensified feelings of exclusion and alienation. Concerns about COVID-19 vaccination were attributed to safety and effectiveness, partly informed by experiences and legacies of racial discrimination and exploitation. Inequality in the pandemic response and COVID-19 outcomes heightened participants' sense that their views and needs were being overlooked, and government sources and information were perceived as coercive. Our model depicts the interplay between institutional trust, belonging, and message perception, which shaped participants' vaccination decisions and led to (non-)engagement with COVID-19 vaccination. This research enhances understanding of how social and contextual factors may influence migrants' engagement with health interventions. It underscores the importance of partnering with migrant communities to understand their needs in context and co-design tailored interventions and inclusive messaging strategies that promote trust and belonging.

38978567,Spatial Deconvolution of Cell Types and Cell States at Scale Utilizing TACIT.,"Identifying cell types and states remains a time-consuming, error-prone challenge for spatial biology. While deep learning is increasingly used, it is difficult to generalize due to variability at the level of cells, neighborhoods, and niches in health and disease. To address this, we developed TACIT, an unsupervised algorithm for cell annotation using predefined signatures that operates without training data. TACIT uses unbiased thresholding to distinguish positive cells from background, focusing on relevant markers to identify ambiguous cells in multiomic assays. Using five datasets (5,000,000-cells; 51-cell types) from three niches (brain, intestine, gland), TACIT outperformed existing unsupervised methods in accuracy and scalability. Integrating TACIT-identified cell types with a novel Shiny app revealed new phenotypes in two inflammatory gland diseases. Finally, using combined spatial transcriptomics and proteomics, we discovered under- and overrepresented immune cell types and states in regions of interest, suggesting multimodality is essential for translating spatial biology to clinical applications.","Khoa L A Huynh, Katarzyna M Tyc, Bruno F Matuck, Quinn T Easter, Aditya Pratapa, Nikhil V Kumar, Paola Pérez, Rachel J Kulchar, Thomas J F Pranzatelli, Deiziane de Souza, Theresa M Weaver, Xufeng Qu, Luiz Alberto Valente Soares Junior, Marisa Dolhnokoff, David E Kleiner, Stephen M Hewitt, Luiz Fernando Ferraz da Silva, Vanderson Geraldo Rocha, Blake M Warner, Kevin M Byrd, Jinze Liu",Research square,2024,artificial intelligence; brain; cell typing; deep learning; fluorescence microscopy; intestine; machine learning; multimodal; multiplex imaging; proteomics; salivary gland; single cell analysis; spatial biology; spatial multiomics; transcriptomics,10.21203/rs.3.rs-4536158/v1,"Department of Biostatistics, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, USA.; Department of Biostatistics, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, USA.; Lab of Oral & Craniofacial Innovation (LOCI), Department of Innovation & Technology Research, ADA Science & Research Institute, Gaithersburg, MD, USA.; Lab of Oral & Craniofacial Innovation (LOCI), Department of Innovation & Technology Research, ADA Science & Research Institute, Gaithersburg, MD, USA.; Department of Cell Biology, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA.; Lab of Oral & Craniofacial Innovation (LOCI), Department of Innovation & Technology Research, ADA Science & Research Institute, Gaithersburg, MD, USA.; Salivary Disorders Unit, National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.; Salivary Disorders Unit, National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.; Adeno-Associated Virus Biology Section, National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.; Department of Pathology, Medicine School of University of Sao Paulo, SP, BR.; Lab of Oral & Craniofacial Innovation (LOCI), Department of Innovation & Technology Research, ADA Science & Research Institute, Gaithersburg, MD, USA.; Massey Cancer Center, Richmond VA, USA.; Division of Dentistry of Hospital das Clinicas of University of Sao Paulo, SP, BR.; Department of Pathology, Medicine School of University of Sao Paulo, SP, BR.; Laboratory of Pathology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.; Laboratory of Pathology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.; Department of Pathology, Medicine School of University of Sao Paulo, SP, BR.; Department of Hematology, Transfusion and Cell Therapy Service, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.; Salivary Disorders Unit, National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.; Lab of Oral & Craniofacial Innovation (LOCI), Department of Innovation & Technology Research, ADA Science & Research Institute, Gaithersburg, MD, USA.; Department of Biostatistics, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, USA.",N/A,P30 CA016059 (NCI NIH HHS); UM1 TR004360 (NCATS NIH HHS),Journal Article; Preprint

38961066,The emerging role of nuclear receptor coactivator 4 in health and disease: a novel bridge between iron metabolism and immunity.,"Nuclear receptor coactivator 4 (NCOA4) has recently been recognized as a selective cargo receptor of ferritinophagy participating in ferroptosis. However, NCOA4 is also a coactivator that modulates the transcriptional activity of many vital nuclear receptors. Recent novel studies have documented the role of NCOA4 in healthy and pathogenic conditions via its modulation of iron- and non-iron-dependent metabolic pathways. NCOA4 exhibits non-ferritinophagic and iron-independent features such as promoting tumorigenesis and erythropoiesis, immunomodulation, regulating autophagy, and participating in DNA replication and mitosis. Full-length human-NCOA4 is composed of 614 amino acids, of which the N-terminal (1-237) contains nuclear-receptor-binding domains, while the C-terminal (238-614) principally contains a ferritin-binding domain. The exploration of the protein structure of NCOA4 suggests that NCOA4 possesses additional significant and complex functions based on its structural domains. Intriguingly, another three isoforms of NCOA4 that are produced by alternative splicing have been identified, which may also display disparate activities in physiological and pathological processes. Thus, NCOA4 has become an important bridge that encompasses interactions between immunity and metabolism. In this review, we outline the latest advances in the important regulating mechanisms underlying NCOA4 actions in health and disease conditions, providing insights into potential therapeutic interventions.","Yue Le, Qinjie Liu, Yi Yang, Jie Wu",Cell death discovery,2024,N/A,10.1038/s41420-024-02075-3,"Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory of Critical Care Medicine, Department of Critical Care Medicine, Zhongda Hospital, School of Medicine, Southeast University, Nanjing, 210009, China.; Department of General Surgery, Zhongda Hospital, School of Medicine, Southeast University, Nanjing, 210009, China.; Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory of Critical Care Medicine, Department of Critical Care Medicine, Zhongda Hospital, School of Medicine, Southeast University, Nanjing, 210009, China. yiyiyang2004@163.com.; Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory of Critical Care Medicine, Department of Critical Care Medicine, Zhongda Hospital, School of Medicine, Southeast University, Nanjing, 210009, China. wujie_jacky@qq.com.",N/A,BK20210039 (Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (Jiangsu Provincial Natural Science Foundation)); 82100597 (National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science Foundation of China)),Journal Article; Review

The human metalloproteomic studies revealed that many families of metalloproteins along with individual metalloproteins are dysregulated under several clinical conditions. Also, several sorts of interaction between redox- active or redox- inert metalloproteins are observed in health and disease. Metalloproteins profiling shows distinct alterations in neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, inflammation, infection, diabetes mellitus, among other diseases.

One of the immune checkpoint inhibitors is P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1); the majority of tumor-infiltrating leukocytes express PSGL-1, causing T cell and immune inhibition via PSGL-1 mediator molecules. We aimed to investigate the effect of variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphism in the second exon of the PSGL-1 gene on MM susceptibility, response to treatment and survival in our patient group. A total of 238 patients diagnosed with MM between January 2010 and January 2021 and 162 healthy individuals as a control group were included in this cross-sectional study. The genotypes of the VNTR polymorphism in the second exon of the PSGL-1 gene were statistically compared between patients and healthy controls; the statistically significant effects of the genotypes on response to first-line treatment and survival were examined. The AC genotype was significantly higher in healthy controls compared to patients diagnosed with MM (p < 0.001). The median PFS in patients with AA/AB/AC was 56 months, while it was 100 months in patients with BB/CC. The hazard ratio of 1.34 for PFS was found to be clinically significant and having the BB/CC genotype could provide a longer PFS compared to others, but it was not statistically significant due to the sample size. Our study results will shed light on new study plans in terms of immune checkpoint target therapies among conventional treatment preferences in MM.","Yasemin Oyaci, Mustafa Pehlivan, Sacide Pehlivan, Tahir Alper Cinli, Fatima Ceren Tuncel, Elif Ertas, Istemi Serin",Molecular carcinogenesis,2024,P‐selectin glycoprotein ligand‐1 (PSGL‐1); multiple myeloma; prognosis; survival; susceptibility,10.1002/mc.23787,"Institute of Graduate Studies in Health Sciences, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey.; Department of Hematology, Basaksehir Cam and Sakura City Hospital, Turkey.; Department of Medical Biology, Istanbul Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University, Fatih, Turkey.; Department of Hematology, Istanbul Training and Research Hospital, University of Health Sciences, Istanbul, Turkey.; Department of Medical Biology, Istanbul Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University, Fatih, Turkey.; Department of Biostatistics, Selcuk University, Konya, Turkey.; Department of Hematology, Agri Training and Research Hospital, Ibrahim Cecen University, Agri, Turkey.","Humans; Multiple Myeloma; Male; Female; Middle Aged; Aged; Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors; Membrane Glycoproteins; Minisatellite Repeats; Polymorphism, Genetic; Exons; Cross-Sectional Studies; Case-Control Studies; Adult; Genotype; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Aged, 80 and over; Prognosis",N/A,Journal Article
38951583,Allergies and risk of head and neck cancer: a case-control study.,"Although the relationship between allergies and cancer has been investigated extensively, the role of allergies in head and neck cancer (HNC) appears less consistent. It is unclear whether allergies can independently influence the risk of HNC in the presence of substantial environmental risk factors, including consumption of alcohol, betel quid, and cigarettes. This study aims to find this association. We examined the relationship between allergies and HNC risk in a hospital-based case-control study with 300 cases and 375 matched controls. Logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals, controlling for age, sex, tobacco smoking and opium usage history, alcohol consumption, and socioeconomic status. Our study showed a significant reduction in the risk of HNC associated with allergy symptoms after adjusting for confounders. The risk of HNC was greatly reduced among those with any type of allergy (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.28, 0.65). The ORs were considerably reduced by 58-88% for different kinds of allergies. The risk of HNC reduction was higher in allergic women than in allergic men (71% vs. 49%). Allergies play an influential role in the risk of HNC development. Future studies investigating immune biomarkers, including cytokine profiles and genetic polymorphisms, are necessary to further delineate the relationship between allergies and HNC. Understanding the relationship between allergies and HNC may help to devise effective strategies to reduce and treat HNC.","Sepehr Fekrazad, Elham Mohebbi, Sepideh Mehravar, Mahsa Mortaja, Farzad Teymouri, Maryam Hadji, Hamideh Rashidian, Ahmad Naghibzadeh-Tahami, Nima Rezaei, Kazem Zendehdel, Mohammad Shirkhoda",Scientific reports,2024,Allergy; Head and neck cancers; Immunology; Onco-allergy,10.1038/s41598-024-65051-y,"Department of General Surgery, Subdivision of Surgical Oncology, Cancer Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.; Department of Oncology, Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, Georgetown University, Washington, DC, USA.; Cancer Research Center, Cancer Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Keshavarz Boulevard, Tehran, Iran.; Cancer Research Center, Cancer Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Keshavarz Boulevard, Tehran, Iran.; Cancer Research Center, Cancer Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Keshavarz Boulevard, Tehran, Iran.; Health Sciences Unit, Faculty of Social Sciences, Tampere University, Tampere, Finland.; Cancer Research Center, Cancer Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Keshavarz Boulevard, Tehran, Iran.; Social Determinants of Health Research Center, Institute for Futures Studies in Health, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran.; Center for Immunodeficiencies, Children's Medical Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.; Cancer Research Center, Cancer Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Keshavarz Boulevard, Tehran, Iran.; Department of General Surgery, Subdivision of Surgical Oncology, Cancer Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. mshirkhoda@sina.tums.ac.ir.",Humans; Male; Female; Head and Neck Neoplasms; Case-Control Studies; Middle Aged; Hypersensitivity; Risk Factors; Aged; Adult; Odds Ratio,N/A,Journal Article

Here, we apply an integrated approach combining Mendelian Randomization and twin-based Direction-of-Causation analyses (MR-DoC) to examine causality underlying smoking-associated blood DNAm changes in the Netherlands Twin Register (N=2577). Evidence across models suggests that current smoking's causal effects on DNAm likely drive many of the previous EWAS findings, implicating functional pathways relevant to several adverse health outcomes of smoking, including hemopoiesis, cell- and neuro-development, and immune regulation. Additionally, we find evidence of potential reverse causal influences at some DNAm sites, with 17 of these sites enriched for gene regulatory functional elements in the brain. The top three sites with evidence of DNAm's effects on smoking annotate to genes involved in G protein-coupled receptor signaling (","Madhurbain Singh, Conor V Dolan, Dana M Lapato, Jouke-Jan Hottenga, René Pool, Brad Verhulst, Dorret I Boomsma, Charles E Breeze, Eco J C de Geus, Gibran Hemani, Josine L Min, Roseann E Peterson, Hermine H M Maes, Jenny van Dongen, Michael C Neale",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,2024,N/A,10.1101/2024.06.19.24309184,"Virginia Institute for Psychiatric and Behavioral Genetics, Department of Psychiatry, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, USA.; Department of Biological Psychology, Vrije Universiteit (VU) Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.; Virginia Institute for Psychiatric and Behavioral Genetics, Department of Psychiatry, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, USA.; Department of Biological Psychology, Vrije Universiteit (VU) Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.; Department of Biological Psychology, Vrije Universiteit (VU) Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.; Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA.; Department of Biological Psychology, Vrije Universiteit (VU) Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.; Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Department Health and Human Services, Bethesda, MD, USA.; Department of Biological Psychology, Vrije Universiteit (VU) Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.; MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK.; MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK.; Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University, Brooklyn, NY, USA.; Virginia Institute for Psychiatric and Behavioral Genetics, Department of Psychiatry, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, USA.; Department of Biological Psychology, Vrije Universiteit (VU) Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.; Virginia Institute for Psychiatric and Behavioral Genetics, Department of Psychiatry, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, USA.",N/A,RC2 MH089951 (NIMH NIH HHS); R01 MH081802 (NIMH NIH HHS); RC2 MH089995 (NIMH NIH HHS); R01 DA049867 (NIDA NIH HHS); EP-C-15-001 (EPA); R01 HD042157 (NICHD NIH HHS); K01 MH131847 (NIMH NIH HHS); R01 MH125938 (NIMH NIH HHS),Journal Article; Preprint

38944200,Guidelines for the purification and characterization of extracellular vesicles of parasites.,"Parasites are responsible for the most neglected tropical diseases, affecting over a billion people worldwide (WHO, 2015) and accounting for billions of cases a year and responsible for several millions of deaths. Research on extracellular vesicles (EVs) has increased in recent years and demonstrated that EVs shed by pathogenic parasites interact with host cells playing an important role in the parasite's survival, such as facilitation of infection, immunomodulation, parasite adaptation to the host environment and the transfer of drug resistance factors. Thus, EVs released by parasites mediate parasite-parasite and parasite-host intercellular communication. In addition, they are being explored as biomarkers of asymptomatic infections and disease prognosis after drug treatment. However, most current protocols used for the isolation, size determination, quantification and characterization of molecular cargo of EVs lack greater rigor, standardization, and adequate quality controls to certify the enrichment or purity of the ensuing bioproducts. We are now initiating major guidelines based on the evolution of collective knowledge in recent years. The main points covered in this position paper are methods for the isolation and molecular characterization of EVs obtained from parasite-infected cell cultures, experimental animals, and patients. The guideline also includes a discussion of suggested protocols and functional assays in host cells.","Carmen Fernandez-Becerra, Patrícia Xander, Daniel Alfandari, George Dong, Iris Aparici-Herraiz, Irit Rosenhek-Goldian, Mehrdad Shokouhy, Melisa Gualdron-Lopez, Nicholy Lozano, Nuria Cortes-Serra, Paula Abou Karam, Paula Meneghetti, Rafael Pedro Madeira, Ziv Porat, Rodrigo Pedro Soares, Adriana Oliveira Costa, Sima Rafati, Anabela-Cordeiro da Silva, Nuno Santarém, Christopher Fernandez-Prada, Marcel I Ramirez, Dolores Bernal, Antonio Marcilla, Vera Lucia Pereira-Chioccola, Lysangela Ronalte Alves, Hernando Del Portillo, Neta Regev-Rudzki, Igor Correia de Almeida, Sergio Schenkman, Martin Olivier, Ana Claudia Torrecilhas",Journal of extracellular biology,2023,EVs methodology;

Using peripheral blood, we assessed soluble proteins, cell composition, T-cell clonality, and tumor antigen-specific antibodies in 54 patients enrolled in the phase 1 component of the trial. NCT01896999 reported high (>75%) overall objective response rates with brentuximab vedotin (BV) in combination with ipilimumab (I) and/or nivolumab (N) in patients with R/R HL. We observed a durable increase in soluble PD1 and plasmacytoid dendritic cells as well as decreases in plasma CCL17, ANGPT2, MMP12, IL13, and CXCL13 in N-containing regimens (BV + N and BV + I + N) compared with BV + I (P < 0.05). Nonresponders and patients with short progression-free survival showed elevated CXCL9, CXCL13, CD5, CCL17, adenosine-deaminase, and MUC16 at baseline or after one treatment cycle and a higher prevalence of NY-ESO-1-specific autoantibodies (P < 0.05).

Standard treatments including surgical resection, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, have failed to significantly improve the prognosis of glioblastoma patients. Currently, immunotherapeutic approaches based on vaccines, chimeric antigen-receptor T-cells, checkpoint inhibitors, and oncolytic virotherapy are showing promising results in clinical trials. The combination of different immunotherapeutic approaches is proving satisfactory and promising. In view of the challenges of immunotherapy and the resistance of glioblastomas, the treatment of these tumors requires further efforts. In this review, we explore the obstacles that potentially influence the efficacy of the response to immunotherapy and that should be taken into account in clinical trials. This article provides a comprehensive review of vaccine therapy for glioblastoma. In addition, we identify the main biomarkers, including isocitrate dehydrogenase, epidermal growth factor receptor, and telomerase reverse transcriptase, known as potential immunotherapeutic targets in glioblastoma, as well as the current status of clinical trials.

Pharmacovigilance strategies employed to gather information on adverse events following immunization (AEFIs) include pre-registration data, media reports, clinical trials, and societal reporting. Early detection of AEFIs during clinical trials is crucial for thorough safety analysis and preventing serious reactions once vaccines are deployed. This review highlights the importance of societal reporting, encompassing contributions from community members, healthcare workers, and pharmaceutical companies. Technological advancements such as quick response (QR) codes can facilitate prompt AEFI reporting. While vaccines are demonstrably safe, the possibility of adverse events necessitates continuous post-marketing surveillance. However, underreporting remains a challenge, underscoring the critical role of public engagement in pharmacovigilance.

In this study, we aimed to clarify the immunological effects of hawthorn vinegar on immunity and general health. We also focused on three different production processes to improve the antioxidant activity of hawthorn vinegar (2) Methods: In the study, besides the traditional production of hawthorn vinegar (N), thermal pasteurization (P) and ultrasound (U) techniques were applied to vinegars. A total of 56 female adult Wistar albino rats were randomly allocated into seven groups; Control, N0.5 (regular vinegar; 0.5 mL/kgbw), N1 (regular vinegar; 1 mL/kgbw), P0.5 (pasteurized vinegar; 0.5 mL/kgbw), P1 (pasteurized vinegar; 1 mL/kgbw), U0.5 (ultrasound treated vinegar; 0.5 mL/kgbw), and U1 (ultrasound treated vinegar; 1 mL/kgbw). Vinegars were administered by oral gavage daily. The average weight gains, body mass index, and blood hematological parameters were measured, and the Neutrophil Lymphocyte ratio was calculated. The plasma IL-1β and TNF-α values, and MDA, IL-1β and TNF-α values of intestinal tissue, were determined. Also, the streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method was applied to determine the expressions of TNF-α and IL-1β in duodenum. (3) Results: There was a decreasing tendency in the average weight gains in all vinegar groups compared to the control group. In addition, there was an increase in NL ratio in all vinegar groups, although not significant. There were no statistical differences among all vinegar groups, although decreases were observed in plasma IL-1β. Also, the plasma TNF-α values showed slight increases in high-dose-of-vinegar groups (N1, P1 and U1), although not significant. In addition, the intestinal tissue IL-1β value tended to increase in groups N0.5, N1 and P0.5, while it tended to decrease in P1, U0.5 and U1.

38931474,Unveiling the Significance of HLA and KIR Diversity in Underrepresented Populations.,"Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules and their relationships with natural killer (NK) cells, specifically through their interaction with killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs), exhibit robust associations with the outcomes of diverse diseases. Moreover, genetic variations in HLA and KIR immune system genes offer limitless depths of complexity. In recent years, a surge of high-powered genome-wide association studies (GWASs) utilizing single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays has occurred, significantly advancing our understanding of disease pathogenesis. Additionally, advances in HLA reference panels have enabled higher resolution and more reliable imputation, allowing for finer-grained evaluation of the association between sequence variations and disease risk. However, it is essential to note that the majority of these GWASs have focused primarily on populations of Caucasian and Asian origins, neglecting underrepresented populations in Latin America and Africa. This omission not only leads to disparities in health care access but also restricts our knowledge of novel genetic variants involved in disease pathogenesis within these overlooked populations. Since the KIR and HLA haplotypes prevalent in each population are clearly modelled by the specific environment, the aim of this review is to encourage studies investigating HLA/KIR involvement in infection and autoimmune diseases, reproduction, and transplantation in underrepresented populations.","Lucía Santiago-Lamelas, Patricia Castro-Santos, Ángel Carracedo, Jordi Olloquequi, Roberto Díaz-Peña",Biomedicines,2024,HLA; KIR; genome-wide association studies; imputation; underrepresented populations,10.3390/biomedicines12061333,"Fundación Pública Galega de Medicina Xenómica, SERGAS, Grupo de Medicina Xenomica-USC, Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria de Santiago (IDIS), 15706 Santiago de Compostela, Spain.; Fundación Pública Galega de Medicina Xenómica, SERGAS, Grupo de Medicina Xenomica-USC, Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria de Santiago (IDIS), 15706 Santiago de Compostela, Spain.; Fundación Pública Galega de Medicina Xenómica, SERGAS, Grupo de Medicina Xenomica-USC, Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria de Santiago (IDIS), 15706 Santiago de Compostela, Spain.; Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Autónoma de Chile, Talca 3460000, Chile.; Fundación Pública Galega de Medicina Xenómica, SERGAS, Grupo de Medicina Xenomica-USC, Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria de Santiago (IDIS), 15706 Santiago de Compostela, Spain.",N/A,1220540 (Fondecyt); PI22/00804 (ISCIII),Journal Article; Review
38931223,Immune-Mediated Ocular Surface Disease in Diabetes Mellitus-Clinical Perspectives and Treatment: A Narrative Review.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder marked by hyperglycemia due to defects in insulin secretion, action, or both, with a global prevalence that has tripled in recent decades. This condition poses significant public health challenges, affecting individuals, healthcare systems, and economies worldwide. Among its numerous complications, ocular surface disease (OSD) is a significant concern, yet understanding its pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management remains challenging. This review aims to explore the epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, diagnostic approaches, and management strategies of diabetes-related OSD. The ocular surface, including the cornea, conjunctiva, and associated structures, is vital for maintaining eye health, with the lacrimal functional unit (LFU) playing a crucial role in tear film regulation. In DM, changes in glycosaminoglycan metabolism, collagen synthesis, oxygen consumption, and LFU dysfunction contribute to ocular complications. Persistent hyperglycemia leads to the expression of cytokines, chemokines, and cell adhesion molecules, resulting in neuropathy, tear film abnormalities, and epithelial lesions. Recent advances in molecular research and therapeutic modalities, such as gene and stem cell therapies, show promise for managing diabetic ocular complications. Future research should focus on pathogenetically oriented therapies for diabetic neuropathy and keratopathy, transitioning from animal models to clinical trials to improve patient outcomes.","Laura Andreea Ghenciu, Ovidiu Alin Hațegan, Sorin Lucian Bolintineanu, Alexandra-Ioana Dănilă, Alexandra Corina Faur, Cătălin Prodan-Bărbulescu, Emil Robert Stoicescu, Roxana Iacob, Alina Maria Șișu",Biomedicines,2024,diabetic keratopathy; diabetic neuropathy; gene therapy; limbal stem cell therapy; ocular immunology; ocular surface disease,10.3390/biomedicines12061303,"Department of Functional Sciences, ""Victor Babes"" University of Medicine and Pharmacy Timisoara, Eftimie Murgu Square No. 2, 300041 Timisoara, Romania.; Discipline of Anatomy and Embriology, Medicine Faculty, 'Vasile Goldis' Western University of Arad, Revolution Boulevard 94, 310025 Arad, Romania.; Department of Anatomy and Embriology, ""Victor Babes"" University of Medicine and Pharmacy Timisoara, Eftimie Murgu Square No. 2, 300041 Timisoara, Romania.; Department of Anatomy and Embriology, ""Victor Babes"" University of Medicine and Pharmacy Timisoara, Eftimie Murgu Square No. 2, 300041 Timisoara, Romania.; Department of Anatomy and Embriology, ""Victor Babes"" University of Medicine and Pharmacy Timisoara, Eftimie Murgu Square No. 2, 300041 Timisoara, Romania.; Department of Anatomy and Embriology, ""Victor Babes"" University of Medicine and Pharmacy Timisoara, Eftimie Murgu Square No. 2, 300041 Timisoara, Romania.; Field of Applied Engineering Sciences, Specialization Statistical Methods and Techniques in Health and Clinical Research, Faculty of Mechanics, 'Politehnica' University Timisoara, Mihai Viteazul Boulevard No. 1, 300222 Timisoara, Romania.; Department of Anatomy and Embriology, ""Victor Babes"" University of Medicine and Pharmacy Timisoara, Eftimie Murgu Square No. 2, 300041 Timisoara, Romania.; Department of Anatomy and Embriology, ""Victor Babes"" University of Medicine and Pharmacy Timisoara, Eftimie Murgu Square No. 2, 300041 Timisoara, Romania.",N/A,N/A,Journal Article; Review
38927540,"Leveraging Multi-Tissue, Single-Cell Atlases as Tools to Elucidate Shared Mechanisms of Immune-Mediated Inflammatory Diseases.","The observation that certain therapeutic strategies for targeting inflammation benefit patients with distinct immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) is exemplified by the success of TNF blockade in conditions including rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, and skin psoriasis, albeit only for subsets of individuals with each condition. This suggests intersecting ""nodes"" in inflammatory networks at a molecular and cellular level may drive and/or maintain IMIDs, being ""shared"" between traditionally distinct diagnoses without mapping neatly to a single clinical phenotype. In line with this proposition, integrative tumour tissue analyses in oncology have highlighted novel cell states acting across diverse cancers, with important implications for precision medicine.

38927510,Restricting datasets to classifiable samples augments discovery of immune disease biomarkers.,"Immunological diseases are typically heterogeneous in clinical presentation, severity and response to therapy. Biomarkers of immune diseases often reflect this variability, especially compared to their regulated behaviour in health. This leads to a common difficulty that frustrates biomarker discovery and interpretation - namely, unequal dispersion of immune disease biomarker expression between patient classes necessarily limits a biomarker's informative range. To solve this problem, we introduce dataset restriction, a procedure that splits datasets into classifiable and unclassifiable samples. Applied to synthetic flow cytometry data, restriction identifies biomarkers that are otherwise disregarded. In advanced melanoma, restriction finds biomarkers of immune-related adverse event risk after immunotherapy and enables us to build multivariate models that accurately predict immunotherapy-related hepatitis. Hence, dataset restriction augments discovery of immune disease biomarkers, increases predictive certainty for classifiable samples and improves multivariate models incorporating biomarkers with a limited informative range. This principle can be directly extended to any classification task.","Gunther Glehr, Paloma Riquelme, Katharina Kronenberg, Robert Lohmayer, Víctor J López-Madrona, Michael Kapinsky, Hans J Schlitt, Edward K Geissler, Rainer Spang, Sebastian Haferkamp, James A Hutchinson",Nature communications,2024,N/A,10.1038/s41467-024-49094-3,"Department of Surgery, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.; Department of Surgery, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.; Department of Surgery, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.; Algorithmic Bioinformatics Research Group, Leibniz Institute for Immunotherapy, Regensburg, Germany.; Aix Marseille Univ, INSERM, INS, Inst Neurosci Syst, Marseille, France.; Beckman Coulter Life Sciences GmbH, Krefeld, Germany.; Department of Surgery, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.; Department of Surgery, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.; Department of Statistical Bioinformatics, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.; Department of Dermatology, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.; Department of Surgery, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany. james.hutchinson@klinik.uni-regensburg.de.",Humans; Biomarkers; Melanoma; Flow Cytometry; Immunotherapy; Immune System Diseases,N/A,Journal Article
38927506,An organometallic hybrid antibiotic of metronidazole with a Gold(I) N-Heterocyclic Carbene overcomes metronidazole resistance in Clostridioides difficile.,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has been emerging as a major global health threat and calls for the development of novel drug candidates. Metal complexes have been demonstrating high efficiency as antibacterial agents that differ substantially from the established types of antibiotics in their chemical structures and their mechanism of action. One strategy to exploit this potential is the design of metal-based hybrid organometallics that consist of an established antibiotic and a metal-based warhead that contributes an additional mechanism of action different from that of the parent antibiotic. In this communication, we describe the organometallic hybrid antibiotic 2c, in which the drug metronidazole is connected to a gold(I) N-heterocyclic carbene warhead that inhibits bacterial thioredoxin reductase (TrxR). Metronidazole can be used for the treatment with the obligatory anaerobic pathogen Clostridioides difficile (C. difficile), however, resistance to the drug hampers its clinical success. The gold organometallic conjugate 2c was an efficient inhibitor of TrxR and it was inactive or showed only minor effects against eucaryotic cells and bacteria grown under aerobic conditions. In contrast, a strong antibacterial effect was observed against both metronidazole-sensitive and -resistant strains of C. difficile. This report presents a proof-of-concept that the design of metal-based hybrid antibiotics can be a viable approach to efficiently tackle AMR.","Rolf Büssing, Arne Bublitz, Bianka Karge, Mark Brönstrup, Till Strowig, Ingo Ott",Journal of biological inorganic chemistry : JBIC : a publication of the Society of Biological Inorganic Chemistry,2024,Antibacterial; Bioorganometallics; Carbene; Gold; Metronidazole,10.1007/s00775-024-02064-y,"Institute of Medicinal and Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Technische Universität Braunschweig, Beethovenstr. 55, 38106, Braunschweig, Germany.; Department of Microbial Immune Regulation, Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research GmbH, Inhoffenstrasse 7, 38124, Braunschweig, Germany.; Department of Chemical Biology, Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research GmbH, Inhoffenstrasse 7, 38124, Braunschweig, Germany.; Department of Chemical Biology, Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research GmbH, Inhoffenstrasse 7, 38124, Braunschweig, Germany.; Department of Microbial Immune Regulation, Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research GmbH, Inhoffenstrasse 7, 38124, Braunschweig, Germany.; Institute of Medicinal and Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Technische Universität Braunschweig, Beethovenstr. 55, 38106, Braunschweig, Germany. ingo.ott@tu-bs.de.","Anti-Bacterial Agents; Clostridioides difficile; Metronidazole; Methane; Gold; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Thioredoxin-Disulfide Reductase; Organometallic Compounds; Heterocyclic Compounds; Molecular Structure; Coordination Complexes",N/A,Journal Article

Globally, vaccination coverage of health workers varied from 10 % to 88 %. Understanding health workers' knowledge and acceptance of the influenza vaccine, particularly among physicians, is crucial for the fine-tuning and continued success of influenza vaccination campaigns. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 472 health workers in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, to inform subsequent subnational and national introductions of influenza vaccine and subsequent campaigns targeting health workers in 2019 (14302), 2020 (14872), and 2021 (24473). Using a purposive sample of university hospitals, general hospitals, rural, and urban health facilities, we interviewed a convenience sample of health workers aged 18 years and older. Physicians had the lowest intention to receive the influenza vaccine (58 %), while nurses (78 %) and midwives (76 %) were the most willing. Across all occupations, intention to receive vaccination increased if the vaccine was offered for free or if recommended by the Ministry of Health. 76 % of respondents believed that the influenza vaccine could prevent illness in health workers. Communication strategies, including about the benefits of influenza vaccination, could raise awareness and acceptance among health workers prior to vaccination campaigns. Influenza vaccination coverage rates between 2019 and 2021 were on par with rates of intention to receive vaccination in the 2018 survey; in 2019, 2020, and 2021, coverage among physicians was 73 %, 73 %, and 52 % and coverage among nurses and midwives was 86 %, 86 %, and 74 % respectively. Improving health workers' knowledge and acceptance of the influenza vaccine, particularly among physicians, is crucial for the continued success of influenza vaccination campaigns.","D Coulibaly, A Douba, K N'Guessan, A K N'Gattia, H Kadjo, M S Ebama, M McCarron, J Bresee",Vaccine,2024,Attitude; Health personnel; Influenza vaccines; Knowledge; Perception,10.1016/j.vaccine.2024.06.043,"Institut National d'Hygiène Publique, Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire.; Institut National d'Hygiène Publique, Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire; Université Félix Houphouët-Boigny, Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire.

38926159,The Immune Checkpoint Protein PD-L1 Regulates Ciliogenesis and Hedgehog Signaling.,"The primary cilium, an antenna-like sensory organelle that protrudes from the surface of most eukaryotic cell types, has become a signaling hub of growing interest given that defects in its structure and/or function are associated with human diseases and syndromes, known as ciliopathies. With the continuously expanding role of primary cilia in health and diseases, identifying new players in ciliogenesis will lead to a better understanding of the function of this organelle. It has been shown that the primary cilium shares similarities with the immune synapse, a highly organized structure at the interface between an antigen-presenting or target cell and a lymphocyte. Studies have demonstrated a role for known cilia regulators in immune synapse formation. However, whether immune synapse regulators modulate ciliogenesis remains elusive. Here, we find that programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), an immune checkpoint protein and regulator of immune synapse formation, plays a role in the regulation of ciliogenesis. We found that PD-L1 is enriched at the centrosome/basal body and Golgi apparatus of ciliated cells and depleting PD-L1 enhanced ciliogenesis and increased the accumulation of ciliary membrane trafficking proteins Rab8a, BBS5, and sensory receptor protein PC-2. Moreover, PD-L1 formed a complex with BBS5 and PC-2. In addition, we found that depletion of PD-L1 resulted in the ciliary accumulation of Gli3 and the downregulation of Gli1. Our results suggest that PD-L1 is a new player in ciliogenesis, contributing to PC-2-mediated sensory signaling and the Hh signaling cascade.","Ewud Agborbesong, Xiaogang Li",Cells,2024,PD-L1; cell biology; cilia protein trafficking; primary cilia,10.3390/cells13121003,"Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.; Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.",Cilia; B7-H1 Antigen; Hedgehog Proteins; Signal Transduction; Humans; Animals; Mice; Centrosome; Golgi Apparatus,R01 DK129241 and R01 DK126662 (NIH HHS); PR221810 (United States Department of Defense),Journal Article

38920633,Frequency-dependent selection of neoantigens fosters tumor immune escape and predicts immunotherapy response.,"Cancer is an evolutionary process shaped by selective pressure from the microenvironments. However, recent studies reveal that certain tumors undergo neutral evolution where there is no detectable fitness difference amongst the cells following malignant transformation. Here, through computational modeling, we demonstrate that negative frequency-dependent selection (or NFDS), where the immune response against cancer cells depends on the clonality of neoantigens, can lead to an immunogenic landscape that is highly similar to neutral evolution. Crucially, NFDS promotes high antigenic heterogeneity and early immune evasion in hypermutable tumors, leading to poor responses to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. Our model also reveals that NFDS is characterized by a negative association between average clonality and total burden of neoantigens. Indeed, this unique feature of NFDS is common in the whole-exome sequencing (WES) datasets (357 tumor samples from 275 patients) from four melanoma cohorts with ICB therapy and a non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) WES dataset (327 tumor samples from 100 patients). Altogether, our study provides quantitative evidence supporting the theory of NFDS in cancer, explaining the high prevalence of neutral-looking tumors. These findings also highlight the critical role of frequency-dependent selection in devising more efficient and predictive immunotherapies.","Shaoqing Chen, Duo Xie, Zan Li, Jiguang Wang, Zheng Hu, Da Zhou",Communications biology,2024,N/A,10.1038/s42003-024-06460-7,"School of Mathematical Sciences, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China.; Key Laboratory of Quantitative Synthetic Biology, Shenzhen Institute of Synthetic Biology, Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen, China.; Life Science Research Center, Core Research Facilities, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, China.; Division of Life Science and State Key Laboratory of Molecular Neuroscience, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong SAR, China.; Key Laboratory of Quantitative Synthetic Biology, Shenzhen Institute of Synthetic Biology, Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen, China. zheng.hu@siat.ac.cn.; School of Mathematical Sciences, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China. zhouda@xmu.edu.cn.","Humans; Immunotherapy; Antigens, Neoplasm; Tumor Escape; Neoplasms; Lung Neoplasms; Melanoma; Tumor Microenvironment; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung",82241236 (National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science Foundation of China)); 32270693 (National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science Foundation of China)); 11971405 (National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science Foundation of China)),Journal Article
38920242,Longitudinal single-cell data informs deterministic modelling of inflammatory bowel disease.,"Single-cell-based methods such as flow cytometry or single-cell mRNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) allow deep molecular and cellular profiling of immunological processes. Despite their high throughput, however, these measurements represent only a snapshot in time. Here, we explore how longitudinal single-cell-based datasets can be used for deterministic ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based modelling to mechanistically describe immune dynamics. We derived longitudinal changes in cell numbers of colonic cell types during inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) from flow cytometry and scRNA-seq data of murine colitis using ODE-based models. Our mathematical model generalised well across different protocols and experimental techniques, and we hypothesised that the estimated model parameters reflect biological processes. We validated this prediction of cellular turnover rates with KI-67 staining and with gene expression information from the scRNA-seq data not used for model fitting. Finally, we tested the translational relevance of the mathematical model by deconvolution of longitudinal bulk mRNA-sequencing data from a cohort of human IBD patients treated with olamkicept. We found that neutrophil depletion may contribute to IBD patients entering remission. The predictive power of IBD deterministic modelling highlights its potential to advance our understanding of immune dynamics in health and disease.","Christoph Kilian, Hanna Ulrich, Viktor A Zouboulis, Paulina Sprezyna, Jasmin Schreiber, Tomer Landsberger, Maren Büttner, Moshe Biton, Eduardo J Villablanca, Samuel Huber, Lorenz Adlung",NPJ systems biology and applications,2024,N/A,10.1038/s41540-024-00395-9,"I.

38911597,Ferroptosis in health and disease.,"Ferroptosis is a pervasive non-apoptotic form of cell death highly relevant in various degenerative diseases and malignancies. The hallmark of ferroptosis is uncontrolled and overwhelming peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids contained in membrane phospholipids, which eventually leads to rupture of the plasma membrane. Ferroptosis is unique in that it is essentially a spontaneous, uncatalyzed chemical process based on perturbed iron and redox homeostasis contributing to the cell death process, but that it is nonetheless modulated by many metabolic nodes that impinge on the cells' susceptibility to ferroptosis. Among the various nodes affecting ferroptosis sensitivity, several have emerged as promising candidates for pharmacological intervention, rendering ferroptosis-related proteins attractive targets for the treatment of numerous currently incurable diseases. Herein, the current members of a Germany-wide research consortium focusing on ferroptosis research, as well as key external experts in ferroptosis who have made seminal contributions to this rapidly growing and exciting field of research, have gathered to provide a comprehensive, state-of-the-art review on ferroptosis. Specific topics include: basic mechanisms, in vivo relevance, specialized methodologies, chemical and pharmacological tools, and the potential contribution of ferroptosis to disease etiopathology and progression. We hope that this article will not only provide established scientists and newcomers to the field with an overview of the multiple facets of ferroptosis, but also encourage additional efforts to characterize further molecular pathways modulating ferroptosis, with the ultimate goal to develop novel pharmacotherapies to tackle the various diseases associated with - or caused by - ferroptosis.","Carsten Berndt, Hamed Alborzinia, Vera Skafar Amen, Scott Ayton, Uladzimir Barayeu, Alexander Bartelt, Hülya Bayir, Christina M Bebber, Kivanc Birsoy, Jan P Böttcher, Simone Brabletz, Thomas Brabletz, Ashley R Brown, Bernhard Brüne, Giorgia Bulli, Alix Bruneau, Quan Chen, Gina M DeNicola, Tobias P Dick, Ayelén Distéfano, Scott J Dixon, Jan B Engler, Julia Esser-von Bieren, Maria Fedorova, José Pedro Friedmann Angeli, Manuel A Friese, Dominic C Fuhrmann, Ana J García-Sáez, Karolina Garbowicz, Magdalena Götz, Wei Gu, Linda Hammerich, Behrouz Hassannia, Xuejun Jiang, Aicha Jeridi, Yun Pyo Kang, Valerian E Kagan, David B Konrad, Stefan Kotschi, Peng Lei, Marlène Le Tertre, Sima Lev, Deguang Liang, Andreas Linkermann, Carolin Lohr, Svenja Lorenz, Tom Luedde, Axel Methner, Bernhard Michalke, Anna V Milton, Junxia Min, Eikan Mishima, Sebastian Müller, Hozumi Motohashi, Martina U Muckenthaler, Shohei Murakami, James A Olzmann, Gabriela Pagnussat, Zijan Pan, Thales Papagiannakopoulos, Lohans Pedrera Puentes, Derek A Pratt, Bettina Proneth, Lukas Ramsauer, Raphael Rodriguez, Yoshiro Saito, Felix Schmidt, Carina Schmitt, Almut Schulze, Annemarie Schwab, Anna Schwantes, Mariluz Soula, Benedikt Spitzlberger, Brent R Stockwell, Leonie Thewes, Oliver Thorn-Seshold, Shinya Toyokuni, Wulf Tonnus, Andreas Trumpp, Peter Vandenabeele, Tom Vanden Berghe, Vivek Venkataramani, Felix C E Vogel, Silvia von Karstedt, Fudi Wang, Frank Westermann, Chantal Wientjens, Christoph Wilhelm, Michele Wölk, Katherine Wu, Xin Yang, Fan Yu, Yilong Zou, Marcus Conrad",Redox biology,2024,Cancer;

38908072,A metabolic switch orchestrated by IL-18 and the cyclic dinucleotide cGAMP programs intestinal tolerance.,"Tissues are exposed to diverse inflammatory challenges that shape future inflammatory responses. While cellular metabolism regulates immune function, how metabolism programs and stabilizes immune states within tissues and tunes susceptibility to inflammation is poorly understood. Here, we describe an innate immune metabolic switch that programs long-term intestinal tolerance. Intestinal interleukin-18 (IL-18) stimulation elicited tolerogenic macrophages by preventing their proinflammatory glycolytic polarization via metabolic reprogramming to fatty acid oxidation (FAO). FAO reprogramming was triggered by IL-18 activation of SLC12A3 (NCC), leading to sodium influx, release of mitochondrial DNA, and activation of stimulator of interferon genes (STING). FAO was maintained in macrophages by a bistable switch that encoded memory of IL-18 stimulation and by intercellular positive feedback that sustained the production of macrophage-derived 2'3'-cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) and epithelial-derived IL-18. Thus, a tissue-reinforced metabolic switch encodes durable immune tolerance in the gut and may enable reconstructing compromised immune tolerance in chronic inflammation.","Randall T Mertens, Aditya Misra, Peng Xiao, Seungbyn Baek, Joseph M Rone, Davide Mangani, Kisha N Sivanathan, Adedamola S Arojojoye, Samuel G Awuah, Insuk Lee, Guo-Ping Shi, Boryana Petrova, Jeannette R Brook, Ana C Anderson, Richard A Flavell, Naama Kanarek, Martin Hemberg, Roni Nowarski",Immunity,2024,IL-18;

38907964,Panel stacking is a threat to consensus statement validity.,"Consensus statements can be very influential in medicine and public health. Some of these statements use systematic evidence synthesis but others fail on this front. Many consensus statements use panels of experts to deduce perceived consensus through Delphi processes. We argue that stacking of panel members toward one particular position or narrative is a major threat, especially in absence of systematic evidence review. Stacking may involve financial conflicts of interest, but nonfinancial conflicts of strong advocacy can also cause major bias. Given their emerging importance, we describe here how such consensus statements may be misleading, by analyzing in depth a recent high-impact Delphi consensus statement on COVID-19 recommendations as a case example. We demonstrate that many of the selected panel members and at least 35% of the core panel members had advocated toward COVID-19 elimination (Zero-COVID) during the pandemic and were leading members of aggressive advocacy groups. These advocacy conflicts were not declared in the Delphi consensus publication, with rare exceptions. Therefore, we propose that consensus statements should always require rigorous evidence synthesis and maximal transparency on potential biases toward advocacy or lobbyist groups to be valid. While advocacy can have many important functions, its biased impact on consensus panels should be carefully avoided.","Kasper P Kepp, Preben Aavitsland, Marcel Ballin, Francois Balloux, Stefan Baral, Kevin Bardosh, Howard Bauchner, Eran Bendavid, Raj Bhopal, Daniel T Blumstein, Paolo Boffetta, Florence Bourgeois, Adam Brufsky, Peter J Collignon, Sally Cripps, Ioana A Cristea, Nigel Curtis, Benjamin Djulbegovic, Oliver Faude, Maria Elena Flacco, Gordon H Guyatt, George Hajishengallis, Lars G Hemkens, Tammy Hoffmann, Ari R Joffe, Terry P Klassen, Despina Koletsi, Dimitrios P Kontoyiannis, Ellen Kuhl, Carlo La Vecchia, Tea Lallukka, John Lambris, Michael Levitt, Spyros Makridakis, Helena C Maltezou, Lamberto Manzoli, Ana Marusic, Clio Mavragani, David Moher, Ben W Mol, Taulant Muka, Florian Naudet, Paul W Noble, Anna Nordström, Peter Nordström, Nikolaos Pandis, Stefania Papatheodorou, Chirag J Patel, Irene Petersen, Stefan Pilz, Nikolaus Plesnila, Anne-Louise Ponsonby, Manuel A Rivas, Andrea Saltelli, Manuel Schabus, Michaéla C Schippers, Holger Schünemann, Marco Solmi, Andreas Stang, Hendrik Streeck, Joachim P Sturmberg, Lehana Thabane, Brett D Thombs, Athanasios Tsakris, Simon N Wood, John P A Ioannidis",Journal of clinical epidemiology,2024,Competing interests;

38906145,Bioactive lipids in the skin barrier mediate its functionality in health and disease.,"Our skin protects us from external threats including ultraviolet radiation, pathogens and chemicals, and prevents excessive trans-epidermal water loss. These varied activities are reliant on a vast array of lipids, many of which are unique to skin, and that support physical, microbiological and immunological barriers. The cutaneous physical barrier is dependent on a specific lipid matrix that surrounds terminally-differentiated keratinocytes in the stratum corneum. Sebum- and keratinocyte-derived lipids cover the skin's surface and support and regulate the skin microbiota. Meanwhile, lipids signal between resident and infiltrating cutaneous immune cells, driving inflammation and its resolution in response to pathogens and other threats. Lipids of particular importance include ceramides, which are crucial for stratum corneum lipid matrix formation and therefore physical barrier functionality, fatty acids, which contribute to the acidic pH of the skin surface and regulate the microbiota, as well as the stratum corneum lipid matrix, and bioactive metabolites of these fatty acids, involved in cell signalling, inflammation, and numerous other cutaneous processes. These diverse and complex lipids maintain homeostasis in healthy skin, and are implicated in many cutaneous diseases, as well as unrelated systemic conditions with skin manifestations, and processes such as ageing. Lipids also contribute to the gut-skin axis, signalling between the two barrier sites. Therefore, skin lipids provide a valuable resource for exploration of healthy cutaneous processes, local and systemic disease development and progression, and accessible biomarker discovery for systemic disease, as well as an opportunity to fully understand the relationship between the host and the skin microbiota. Investigation of skin lipids could provide diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, and help identify new targets for interventions. Development and improvement of existing in vitro and in silico approaches to explore the cutaneous lipidome, as well as advances in skin lipidomics technologies, will facilitate ongoing progress in skin lipid research.","Anna Nicolaou, Alexandra C Kendall",Pharmacology & therapeutics,2024,Bioactive lipids; Ceramides; Microbiota; Skin barrier; Skin disease; Skin immunology,10.1016/j.pharmthera.2024.108681,"Laboratory for Lipidomics and Lipid Biology, Division of Pharmacy and Optometry, School of Health Sciences, Faculty of Biology Medicine and Health, The University of Manchester, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, Manchester M13 9NT, UK; Lydia Becker Institute of Immunology and Inflammation; Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, The University of Manchester, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, Manchester M13 9NT, UK.

38896651,Spatial Deconvolution of Cell Types and Cell States at Scale Utilizing TACIT.,"Identifying cell types and states remains a time-consuming and error-prone challenge for spatial biology. While deep learning is increasingly used, it is difficult to generalize due to variability at the level of cells, neighborhoods, and niches in health and disease. To address this, we developed TACIT, an unsupervised algorithm for cell annotation using predefined signatures that operates without training data, using unbiased thresholding to distinguish positive cells from background, focusing on relevant markers to identify ambiguous cells in multiomic assays. Using five datasets (5,000,000-cells; 51-cell types) from three niches (brain, intestine, gland), TACIT outperformed existing unsupervised methods in accuracy and scalability. Integration of TACIT-identified cell with a novel Shiny app revealed new phenotypes in two inflammatory gland diseases. Finally, using combined spatial transcriptomics and proteomics, we discover under- and overrepresented immune cell types and states in regions of interest, suggesting multimodality is essential for translating spatial biology to clinical applications.","Khoa L A Huynh, Katarzyna M Tyc, Bruno F Matuck, Quinn T Easter, Aditya Pratapa, Nikhil V Kumar, Paola Pérez, Rachel Kulchar, Thomas Pranzatelli, Deiziane de Souza, Theresa M Weaver, Xufeng Qu, Luiz Alberto Valente Soares, Marisa Dolhnokoff, David E Kleiner, Stephen M Hewitt, Luiz Fernando Ferraz da Silva, Vanderson Geraldo Rocha, Blake M Warner, Kevin M Byrd, Jinze Liu",bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology,2024,artificial intelligence; brain; cell typing; deep learning; fluorescence microscopy; intestine; machine learning; multimodal; multiplex imaging; proteomics; salivary gland; single cell analysis; spatial biology; spatial multiomics; transcriptomics,10.1101/2024.05.31.596861,"Department of Biostatistics, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, USA.; Department of Biostatistics, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, USA.; Lab of Oral & Craniofacial Innovation (LOCI), Department of Innovation & Technology Research, ADA Science & Research Institute, Gaithersburg, MD, USA.; Lab of Oral & Craniofacial Innovation (LOCI), Department of Innovation & Technology Research, ADA Science & Research Institute, Gaithersburg, MD, USA.; Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA.; Lab of Oral & Craniofacial Innovation (LOCI), Department of Innovation & Technology Research, ADA Science & Research Institute, Gaithersburg, MD, USA.; Salivary Disorders Unit, National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.; Salivary Disorders Unit, National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.; Adeno-Associated Virus Biology Section, National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.; Department of Pathology, Medicine School of University of Sao Paulo, SP, BR.; Lab of Oral & Craniofacial Innovation (LOCI), Department of Innovation & Technology Research, ADA Science & Research Institute, Gaithersburg, MD, USA.; Massey Cancer Center, Richmond VA, USA.; Division of Dentistry of Hospital das Clinicas of University of Sao Paulo, SP, BR.; Department of Pathology, Medicine School of University of Sao Paulo, SP, BR.; Laboratory of Pathology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.; Laboratory of Pathology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.; Department of Pathology, Medicine School of University of Sao Paulo, SP, BR.; Department of Hematology, Transfusion and Cell Therapy Service, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.; Salivary Disorders Unit, National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.; Lab of Oral & Craniofacial Innovation (LOCI), Department of Innovation & Technology Research, ADA Science & Research Institute, Gaithersburg, MD, USA.; Department of Biostatistics, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, USA.",N/A,P30 CA016059 (NCI NIH HHS); UM1 TR004360 (NCATS NIH HHS),Journal Article; Preprint
38895407,Combining Sound and Deep Neural Networks for the Measurement of Jump Height in Sports Science.,"Jump height tests are employed to measure lower-limb muscle power of athletic and non-athletic populations. The most popular instruments for this purpose are jump mats and, in recent years, smartphone apps, which compute jump height through the manual annotation of video recordings and recently automatically using the sound produced during the jump to extract the flight time. In a previous work, the afore-mentioned sound systems were presented by the authors in which the take-off and landing events from the audio recordings of jump executions were obtained using classical signal processing. In this work, a more precise, noise-immune, and robust system, capable of working in the most unfavorable environments, is presented. The system uses a deep neural network trained specifically for this purpose. More than 300 jumps were recorded to train and validate the network performance. The ground truth was a jump mat, providing a slightly better accuracy in quiet and medium quiet environments but excellent accuracy in noisy and complicated ones. The developed audio-based system is a trustworthy instrument for measuring jump height accurately in any kind of environment, providing a perfect measurement tool that can be accessed through a mobile phone in the form of an app.","Lucas Banchero, Jose J Lopez, Basilio Pueo, Jose M Jimenez-Olmedo","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2024,CNN; accuracy; detection; instrument; reliability; robustness; signal; test; validation,10.3390/s24113505,"Institute of Telecommunications and Multimedia Applications, Universitat Politecnica de Valencia, 46022 Valencia, Spain.; Institute of Telecommunications and Multimedia Applications, Universitat Politecnica de Valencia, 46022 Valencia, Spain.; University Institute for Computing Research, University of Alicante, 03690 Alicante, Spain.; Research Group in Health, Physical Activity, and Sports Technology, University of Alicante, 03690 Alicante, Spain.","Humans; Neural Networks, Computer; Sound; Mobile Applications; Smartphone; Sports; Male; Muscle Strength",N/A,Journal Article
38895230,"Dietary Patterns, Gut Microbiota and Sports Performance in Athletes: A Narrative Review.","The intestinal tract of humans harbors a dynamic and complex bacterial community known as the gut microbiota, which plays a crucial role in regulating functions such as metabolism and immunity in the human body. Numerous studies conducted in recent decades have also highlighted the significant potential of the gut microbiota in promoting human health. It is widely recognized that training and nutrition strategies are pivotal factors that allow athletes to achieve optimal performance. Consequently, there has been an increasing focus on whether training and dietary patterns influence sports performance through their impact on the gut microbiota. In this review, we aim to present the concept and primary functions of the gut microbiota, explore the relationship between exercise and the gut microbiota, and specifically examine the popular dietary patterns associated with athletes' sports performance while considering their interaction with the gut microbiota. Finally, we discuss the potential mechanisms by which dietary patterns affect sports performance from a nutritional perspective, aiming to elucidate the intricate interplay among dietary patterns, the gut microbiota, and sports performance. We have found that the precise application of specific dietary patterns (ketogenic diet, plant-based diet, high-protein diet, Mediterranean diet, and high intake of carbohydrate) can improve vascular function and reduce the risk of illness in health promotion, etc., as well as promoting recovery and controlling weight with regard to improving sports performance, etc. In conclusion, although it can be inferred that certain aspects of an athlete's ability may benefit from specific dietary patterns mediated by the gut microbiota to some extent, further high-quality clinical studies are warranted to substantiate these claims and elucidate the underlying mechanisms.","Yonglin Chen, Keer Yang, Mingxin Xu, Yishuo Zhang, Xiquan Weng, Jiaji Luo, Yanshuo Li, Yu-Heng Mao",Nutrients,2024,athlete; dietary pattern; gut microbiome; sports performance,10.3390/nu16111634,"School of Exercise and Health, Guangzhou Sport University, Guangzhou 510500, China.; School of Exercise and Health, Guangzhou Sport University, Guangzhou 510500, China.; The Fifth College of Clinical Medicine, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou 510500, China.; School of Exercise and Health, Guangzhou Sport University, Guangzhou 510500, China.; School of Exercise and Health, Guangzhou Sport University, Guangzhou 510500, China.; School of Exercise and Health, Guangzhou Sport University, Guangzhou 510500, China.; School of Exercise and Health, Guangzhou Sport University, Guangzhou 510500, China.; School of Exercise and Health, Guangzhou Sport University, Guangzhou 510500, China.",Humans; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Athletic Performance; Athletes; Diet; Sports Nutritional Physiological Phenomena; Exercise; Feeding Behavior; Dietary Patterns,2023A1515010004 (Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation); 2023ZDZX2035 (Special Funds in Key Areas of Guangdong Provincial Department of Education); 82003434 (National Natural Science Foundation of China),Journal Article; Review
38894296,The Skin-Brain Axis: From UV and Pigmentation to Behaviour Modulation.,"The skin-brain axis has been suggested to play a role in several pathophysiological conditions, including opioid addiction, Parkinson's disease and many others. Recent evidence suggests that pathways regulating skin pigmentation may directly and indirectly regulate behaviour. Conversely, CNS-driven neural and hormonal responses have been demonstrated to regulate pigmentation, e.g., under stress. Additionally, due to the shared neuroectodermal origins of the melanocytes and neurons in the CNS, certain CNS diseases may be linked to pigmentation-related changes due to common regulators, e.g., MC1R variations. Furthermore, the HPA analogue of the skin connects skin pigmentation to the endocrine system, thereby allowing the skin to index possible hormonal abnormalities visibly. In this review, insight is provided into skin pigment production and neuromelanin synthesis in the brain and recent findings are summarised on how signalling pathways in the skin, with a particular focus on pigmentation, are interconnected with the central nervous system. Thus, this review may supply a better understanding of the mechanism of several skin-brain associations in health and disease.","Anna A Ascsillán, Lajos V Kemény",International journal of molecular sciences,2024,ACTH; Addison’s disease; HPA axis; MC1R; MITF; MSH; POMC; Parkinson’s disease; UVR; central nervous system; cortisol; eumelanin; keratinocyte; melanocyte; melanogenesis; melanoma; neuromelanin; nociception; opioid signalling; pheomelanin; pigmentation; redhead; skin; skin–brain axis; tyrosinase; vitamin D,10.3390/ijms25116199,"Department of Dermatology, Venereology and Dermatooncology, Faculty of Medicine, Semmelweis University, 1085 Budapest, Hungary.; Department of Dermatology, Venereology and Dermatooncology, Faculty of Medicine, Semmelweis University, 1085 Budapest, Hungary.",Humans; Skin Pigmentation; Brain; Animals; Skin; Ultraviolet Rays; Melanins; Signal Transduction; Behavior,739593 (EU's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program); OTKA FK138696 (STIA-KFI grant from Semmelweis University),Journal Article; Review
38892567,Anti-HIV Humoral Response Induced by Different Anti-Idiotype Antibody Formats: An In Silico and In Vivo Approach.,"Despite advancements in vaccinology, there is currently no effective anti-HIV vaccine. One strategy under investigation is based on the identification of epitopes recognized by broadly neutralizing antibodies to include in vaccine preparation. Taking into account the benefits of anti-idiotype molecules and the diverse biological attributes of different antibody formats, our aim was to identify the most immunogenic antibody format. This format could serve as a foundational element for the development of an oligo-polyclonal anti-idiotype vaccine against HIV-1. For our investigation, we anchored our study on an established b12 anti-idiotype, referred to as P1, and proposed four distinct formats: two single chains and two minibodies, both in two different orientations. For a deeper characterization of these molecules, we used immunoinformatic tools and tested them on rabbits. Our studies have revealed that a particular minibody conformation, MbVHVL, emerges as the most promising candidate. It demonstrates a significant binding affinity with b12 and elicits a humoral anti-HIV-1 response in rabbits similar to the Fab format. This study marks the first instance where the minibody format has been shown to provoke a humoral response against a pathogen. Furthermore, this format presents biological advantages over the Fab format, including bivalency and being encoded by a monocistronic gene, making it better suited for the development of RNA-based vaccines.","Valeria Caputo, Ilaria Negri, Louiza Moudoud, Martina Libera, Luigi Bonizzi, Massimo Clementi, Roberta Antonia Diotti",International journal of molecular sciences,2024,HIV vaccine; anti-idiotype; antibody; immunoinformatic; minibody,10.3390/ijms25115737,"Pomona Ricerca S.r.l, Via Assarotti 7, 10122 Turin, Italy.; Pomona Ricerca S.r.l, Via Assarotti 7, 10122 Turin, Italy.; Pomona Ricerca S.r.l, Via Assarotti 7, 10122 Turin, Italy.; Pomona Ricerca S.r.l, Via Assarotti 7, 10122 Turin, Italy.; One Health Unit, Department of Biomedical, Surgical and Dental Sciences, School of Medicine, University of Milan, Via Pascal 36, 20133 Milan, Italy.; Pomona Ricerca S.r.l, Via Assarotti 7, 10122 Turin, Italy.; Pomona Ricerca S.r.l, Via Assarotti 7, 10122 Turin, Italy.","Animals; Rabbits; HIV Antibodies; HIV-1; Immunity, Humoral; Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic; AIDS Vaccines; HIV Infections; Humans; Antibodies, Neutralizing; Computer Simulation; Epitopes",N/A,Journal Article
38892387,New Insight into Intestinal Mast Cells Revealed by Single-Cell RNA Sequencing.,"Mast cells (MCs) are tissue-resident immune cells distributed in all tissues and strategically located close to blood and lymphatic vessels and nerves. Thanks to the expression of a wide array of receptors, MCs act as tissue sentinels, able to detect the presence of bacteria and parasites and to respond to different environmental stimuli. MCs originate from bone marrow (BM) progenitors that enter the circulation and mature in peripheral organs under the influence of microenvironment factors, thus differentiating into heterogeneous tissue-specific subsets. Even though MC activation has been traditionally linked to IgE-mediated allergic reactions, a role for these cells in other pathological conditions including tumor progression has recently emerged. However, several aspects of MC biology remain to be clarified. The advent of single-cell RNA sequencing platforms has provided the opportunity to understand MCs' origin and differentiation as well as their phenotype and functions within different tissues, including the gut. This review recapitulates how single-cell transcriptomic studies provided insight into MC development as well as into the functional role of intestinal MC subsets in health and disease.","Erisa Putro, Alessia Carnevale, Caterina Marangio, Valerio Fulci, Rossella Paolini, Rosa Molfetta",International journal of molecular sciences,2024,colorectal cancer; gut inflammation; intestinal mast cells,10.3390/ijms25115594,"Department of Molecular Medicine, Laboratory Affiliated to Istituto Pasteur Italia-Fondazione Cenci Bolognetti, Sapienza University of Rome, 00161 Rome, Italy.; Department of Molecular Medicine, Laboratory Affiliated to Istituto Pasteur Italia-Fondazione Cenci Bolognetti, Sapienza University of Rome, 00161 Rome, Italy.; Department of Molecular Medicine, Laboratory Affiliated to Istituto Pasteur Italia-Fondazione Cenci Bolognetti, Sapienza University of Rome, 00161 Rome, Italy.; Department of Molecular Medicine, Laboratory Affiliated to Istituto Pasteur Italia-Fondazione Cenci Bolognetti, Sapienza University of Rome, 00161 Rome, Italy.; Department of Molecular Medicine, Laboratory Affiliated to Istituto Pasteur Italia-Fondazione Cenci Bolognetti, Sapienza University of Rome, 00161 Rome, Italy.; Department of Molecular Medicine, Laboratory Affiliated to Istituto Pasteur Italia-Fondazione Cenci Bolognetti, Sapienza University of Rome, 00161 Rome, Italy.","Humans; Mast Cells; Single-Cell Analysis; Animals; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Transcriptome; Intestines; Cell Differentiation",AIRC IG-24955 (Italian Association for Cancer Research); 2020-366 (Istituto Pasteur Italia-Fondazione Cenci Bolognetti),Journal Article; Review

38886845,Therapeutic potential of probiotics in gut microbial homeostasis and Rheumatoid arthritis.,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation and joint damage. Existing treatment options primarily focus on managing symptoms and slowing disease progression, often with side effects and limitations. The gut microbiome, a vast community of microorganisms present in the gastrointestinal tract, plays a crucial role in health and disease. Recent research suggests a bidirectional relationship between the gut microbiome and RA, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic option. This review focuses on the interaction between the gut microbiome and RA development, by discussing how dysbiosis, an imbalance in gut bacteria, can contribute to RA through multiple mechanisms such as molecular mimicry, leaky gut, and metabolic dysregulation. Probiotics, live microorganisms with health benefits, are emerging as promising tools for managing RA. They can prevent the negative effects of dysbiosis by displacing harmful bacteria, producing anti-inflammatory metabolites like short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), Directly influencing immune cells, and modifying host metabolism. animal and clinical studies demonstrate the potential of probiotics in improving RA symptoms and disease outcomes. However, further research is needed to optimize probiotic strains, dosages, and treatment protocols for personalized and effective management of RA. This review summarizes the current understanding of the gut microbiome and its role in RA and discusses future research directions. In addition to the established role of gut dysbiosis in RA, emerging strategies like fecal microbiota transplantation, prebiotics, and postbiotics offer exciting possibilities. However, individual variations in gut composition necessitate personalized treatment plans. Long-term effects and clear regulations need to be established. Future research focusing on metagenomic analysis, combination therapies, and mechanistic understanding will unlock the full potential of gut microbiome modulation for effective RA management.","Dhivyadharshini Balasundaram, Veeramurugan Veerasamy, Magdalin Sylvia Singarayar, Vivek Neethirajan, Arul Ananth Devanesan, Sivasudha Thilagar",International immunopharmacology,2024,Dysbiosis; Gut microbiome; Leaky gut; Probiotics; Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA); Short Chain Fatty Acids (SCFA),10.1016/j.intimp.2024.112501,"Department of Environmental Biotechnology, Bharathidasan University, Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu 620024, India.; Department of Environmental Biotechnology, Bharathidasan University, Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu 620024, India.; Department of Environmental Biotechnology, Bharathidasan University, Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu 620024, India.; Department of Environmental Biotechnology, Bharathidasan University, Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu 620024, India.; Department of Biotechnology, The American College, Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India.; Department of Environmental Biotechnology, Bharathidasan University, Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu 620024, India.

38886736,Beneficial islet inflammation in health depends on pericytic TLR/MyD88 signaling.,"While inflammation is beneficial for insulin secretion during homeostasis, its transformation adversely affects β cells and contributes to diabetes. However, the regulation of islet inflammation for maintaining glucose homeostasis remains largely unknown. Here, we identified pericytes as pivotal regulators of islet immune and β cell function in health. Islets and pancreatic pericytes express various cytokines in healthy humans and mice. To interfere with the pericytic inflammatory response, we selectively inhibited the TLR/MyD88 pathway in these cells in transgenic mice. The loss of MyD88 impaired pericytic cytokine production. Furthermore, MyD88-deficient mice exhibited skewed islet inflammation with fewer cells, an impaired macrophage phenotype, and reduced IL-1β production. This aberrant pericyte-orchestrated islet inflammation was associated with β cell dedifferentiation and impaired glucose response. Additionally, we found that Cxcl1, a pericytic MyD88-dependent cytokine, promoted immune IL-1β production. Treatment with either Cxcl1 or IL-1β restored the mature β cell phenotype and glucose response in transgenic mice, suggesting a potential mechanism through which pericytes and immune cells regulate glucose homeostasis. Our study revealed pericyte-orchestrated islet inflammation as a crucial element in glucose regulation, implicating this process as a potential therapeutic target for diabetes.","Anat Schonblum, Dunia Ali Naser, Shai Ovadia, Mohammed Egbaria, Shani Puyesky, Alona Epshtein, Tomer Wald, Sophia Mercado-Medrez, Ruth Ashery-Padan, Limor Landsman",The Journal of clinical investigation,2024,Diabetes; Inflammation; Islet cells; Metabolism; Pericytes,10.1172/JCI179335,"Department of Cell and Development Biology, Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences and.; Department of Cell and Development Biology, Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences and.; Department of Human Molecular Genetics and Biochemistry, Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences and Sagol School of Neuroscience, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.; Department of Cell and Development Biology, Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences and.; Department of Cell and Development Biology, Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences and.; Department of Cell and Development Biology, Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences and.; Department of Cell and Development Biology, Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences and.; Department of Cell and Development Biology, Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences and.; Department of Human Molecular Genetics and Biochemistry, Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences and Sagol School of Neuroscience, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.; Department of Cell and Development Biology, Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences and.","Animals; Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88; Mice; Pericytes; Humans; Signal Transduction; Inflammation; Interleukin-1beta; Mice, Transgenic; Toll-Like Receptors; Chemokine CXCL1; Islets of Langerhans; Mice, Knockout; Insulin-Secreting Cells; Male; Glucose",N/A,Journal Article

38880646,Single-cell and spatially resolved interactomics of tooth-associated keratinocytes in periodontitis.,"Periodontitis affects billions of people worldwide. To address relationships of periodontal niche cell types and microbes in periodontitis, we generated an integrated single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) atlas of human periodontium (34-sample, 105918-cell), including sulcular and junctional keratinocytes (SK/JKs). SK/JKs displayed altered differentiation states and were enriched for effector cytokines in periodontitis. Single-cell metagenomics revealed 37 bacterial species with cell-specific tropism. Fluorescence in situ hybridization detected intracellular 16 S and mRNA signals of multiple species and correlated with SK/JK proinflammatory phenotypes in situ. Cell-cell communication analysis predicted keratinocyte-specific innate and adaptive immune interactions. Highly multiplexed immunofluorescence (33-antibody) revealed peri-epithelial immune foci, with innate cells often spatially constrained around JKs. Spatial phenotyping revealed immunosuppressed JK-microniches and SK-localized tertiary lymphoid structures in periodontitis. Here, we demonstrate impacts on and predicted interactomics of SK and JK cells in health and periodontitis, which requires further investigation to support precision periodontal interventions in states of chronic inflammation.","Quinn T Easter, Bruno Fernandes Matuck, Germán Beldorati Stark, Catherine L Worth, Alexander V Predeus, Brayon Fremin, Khoa Huynh, Vaishnavi Ranganathan, Zhi Ren, Diana Pereira, Brittany T Rupp, Theresa Weaver, Kathryn Miller, Paola Perez, Akira Hasuike, Zhaoxu Chen, Mandy Bush, Xufeng Qu, Janice Lee, Scott H Randell, Shannon M Wallet, Inês Sequeira, Hyun Koo, Katarzyna M Tyc, Jinze Liu, Kang I Ko, Sarah A Teichmann, Kevin M Byrd",Nature communications,2024,N/A,10.1038/s41467-024-49037-y,"Lab of Oral & Craniofacial Innovation (LOCI), Department of Innovation & Technology Research, ADA Science & Research Institute, Gaithersburg, MD, USA.; Lab of Oral & Craniofacial Innovation (LOCI), Department of Innovation & Technology Research, ADA Science & Research Institute, Gaithersburg, MD, USA.; Parse Biosciences, Seattle, WA, USA.; The Bioinformatics CRO, Orlando, FL, USA.; Wellcome Sanger Institute, Wellcome Genome Campus, Hinxton, Cambridge, UK.; The Bioinformatics CRO, Orlando, FL, USA.; Department of Biostatistics, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, USA.; School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.; Biofilm Research Laboratories, Center for Innovation & Precision Dentistry, School of Dental Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.; Center for Oral Immunobiology and Regenerative Medicine, Barts Centre for Squamous Cancer, Institute of Dentistry, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK.; Lab of Oral & Craniofacial Innovation (LOCI), Department of Innovation & Technology Research, ADA Science & Research Institute, Gaithersburg, MD, USA.; Lab of Oral & Craniofacial Innovation (LOCI), Department of Innovation & Technology Research, ADA Science & Research Institute, Gaithersburg, MD, USA.; Akoya Biosciences Inc., Marlborough, MA, USA.; Salivary Disorders Unit, National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.; Lab of Oral & Craniofacial Innovation (LOCI), Department of Innovation & Technology Research, ADA Science & Research Institute, Gaithersburg, MD, USA.; Department of Periodontics, School of Dental Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.; Respiratory TRACTS Core, Marsico Lung Institute, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.; VCU Massey Comprehensive Cancer Center, Bioinformatics Shared Resource Core, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, USA.; Craniofacial Anomalies & Regeneration Section, National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.; Marsico Lung Institute, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.; Division of Oral and Craniofacial Health Sciences, Adams School of Dentistry, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.; Center for Oral Immunobiology and Regenerative Medicine, Barts Centre for Squamous Cancer, Institute of Dentistry, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK.; Biofilm Research Laboratories, Center for Innovation & Precision Dentistry, School of Dental Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.; Department of Biostatistics, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, USA.; Department of Biostatistics, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, USA.; Department of Periodontics, School of Dental Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.; Wellcome Sanger Institute, Wellcome Genome Campus, Hinxton, Cambridge, UK.; Lab of Oral & Craniofacial Innovation (LOCI), Department of Innovation & Technology Research, ADA Science & Research Institute, Gaithersburg, MD, USA. kevinmbyrd@gmail.com.","Humans; Keratinocytes; Single-Cell Analysis; Periodontitis; Cell Communication; Cytokines; Periodontium; Immunity, Innate; In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence; Male; Metagenomics; Bacteria; Female; Adult; Adaptive Immunity",1K99DE033428 (U.S. Department of Health & Human Services | NIH | National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR)),Journal Article

However, the overall response remains low. To address this limitation, here we describe a novel platform, termed antibody-conjugated drug-loaded nanotherapeutics (ADN), which combines immunotherapy and molecularly targeted therapy. An ADN was designed with an anti-CD47 and anti-programmed death ligand 1 (PDL1) antibody pair on the surface of the nanoparticle and a molecularly targeted inhibitor of the PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase)/AKT/mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway, PI103, entrapped in the nanoparticle. The anti-CD47-PDL1-ADN exhibited greater antitumor efficacy than current treatment options with a PDL1 inhibitor in vivo in an aggressive lung cancer immunocompetent mouse model. Dual antibody-drug-loaded nanotherapeutics can emerge as an attractive platform to improve outcomes with cancer immunotherapy.","Tanmoy Saha, Michaela Fojtů, Astha Vinay Nagar, Liya Thurakkal, Balaaji Baanupriya Srinivasan, Meghma Mukherjee, Astralina Sibiyon, Heena Aggarwal, Akash Samuel, Chinmayee Dash, Hae Lin Jang, Shiladitya Sengupta",Science advances,2024,N/A,10.1126/sciadv.adi2046,"Division of Engineering in Medicine, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Division of Engineering in Medicine, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Division of Engineering in Medicine, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Division of Engineering in Medicine, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Division of Engineering in Medicine, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Division of Engineering in Medicine, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Division of Engineering in Medicine, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Division of Engineering in Medicine, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Division of Engineering in Medicine, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Division of Engineering in Medicine, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Center for Engineered Therapeutics, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; Division of Engineering in Medicine, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.","Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Animals; Lung Neoplasms; Immunotherapy; Humans; Mice; Nanoparticles; Cell Line, Tumor; B7-H1 Antigen; Immunoconjugates; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays; Disease Models, Animal; CD47 Antigen; Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors",N/A,Journal Article

38869080,"ROBVALU: a tool for assessing risk of bias in studies about people's values, utilities, or importance of health outcomes.","People’s values are an important driver in healthcare decision making. The certainty of an intervention’s effect on benefits and harms relies on two factors: the certainty in the measured effect on an outcome in terms of risk difference and the certainty in its value, also known as utility or importance. The GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations) working group has proposed a set of questions to assess the risk of bias in a body of evidence from studies investigating how people value outcomes. However, these questions do not address risk of bias in individual studies that, similar to risk-of-bias tools for other research studies, is required to evaluate such evidence. Thus, the Risk of Bias in studies of Values and Utilities (ROBVALU) tool was developed. ROBVALU has good psychometric properties and will be useful when assessing individual studies in measuring values, utilities, or the importance of outcomes. As such, ROBVALU can be used to assess risk of bias in studies included in systematic reviews and health guidelines.

38861917,Perisynaptic Schwann Cells: Guardians of Neuromuscular Junction Integrity and Function in Health and Disease.,"The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is a highly reliable synapse to carry the control of the motor commands of the nervous system over the muscles. Its development, organization, and synaptic properties are highly structured and regulated to support such reliability and efficacy. Yet, the NMJ is also highly plastic, able to react to injury, and able to adapt to changes. This balance between structural stability and synaptic efficacy on one hand and structural plasticity and repair on another hand is made possible by perisynaptic Schwann cells (PSCs), glial cells at this synapse. They regulate synaptic efficacy and structural plasticity of the NMJ in a dynamic, bidirectional manner owing to their ability to decode synaptic transmission and by their interactions with trophic-related factors. Alteration of these fundamental roles of PSCs is also important in the maladapted response of NMJs in various diseases and in aging.","Thomas W Gould, Chien-Ping Ko, Hugh Willison, Richard Robitaille",Cold Spring Harbor perspectives in biology,2024,N/A,10.1101/cshperspect.a041362,"Department of Physiology and Cell Biology, University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine, Reno, Nevada 89557, USA.; Section of Neurobiology, Department of Biological Sciences, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California 90089-2520, USA.; School of Infection and Immunity, University of Glasgow, Glasgow G12 8TA, Scotland.; Département de neurosciences, Université de Montréal, Montréal, Québec H3C 3J7, Canada richard.robitaille@umontreal.ca.",N/A,N/A,Journal Article
38861830,"Leukolectins support lifelong innate immunity in lower vertebrates, and reveal dichotomies of several leukocytic lineages.","Innate immunity is vital for animal homeostasis and survival. First-line immuno-defense for fish larvae involves mucus enriched with leukolectin (LL) secreted by dermal lectocytes. Later during the critical transition from yolk-nutrition to feeding, additional larval immuno-protection in zebrafish (zF) is provided by macrophages containing LL (lectophages). This work investigated new LL-expression in embryos and in blood, structures of fish leukocytic LL and LL-genes, and LL-presence in chicken leukocytes. In zF-embryos, lectophages appear ∼10 hpf, while later, cells co-expressing myeloperoxidase- and LL-mRNA were detected (∼19 hpf). Furthermore, protein-extracts of Atlantic salmon (Ssal) leukocytes contained LL-proteins, compartmentalized in the cytosol. Cloning and sequencing revealed 94 % nt-sequence identity between variants of Ssal-leukolectins. Highly conserved LLs allowed production of epitope-specific anti-LL IgGs. Immuno-fluorescence-analysis demonstrated that most Ssal-bloodcells were LL-negative, but both some large cells with protrusions and some small, rounded cells did express LL. Immunoperoxidase-staining method confirmed LL-expression in some Ssal-leukocytes, identified as macrophages, PMN-leukocytes, thrombocytes and dendritic cells. However, closer examination revealed a dichotomy of these cell-categories into either LL-positive, or LL-negative variants. In situ hybridization demonstrated profuse LL-expression in Ssal head kidney interstitial tissue, while LL-transcripts were absent in large kidney tubules. Both hematopoietic (non-pigmented) marrow cells and melano-macrophages expressed LL-mRNA, implying that leukolectins provide lifelong innate immuno-protection. PCR-amplification using Ssal-leukocytic DNA as template, and direct sequencing yielded a leukocytic ll-gene. Some cells in salmon, cod, halibut, oikopleura and zebrafish embryos express LL-proteins and/or LL-mRNA, and LL-mRNA is detected in salmon, cod and chicken leukocytes. However, current genomes for these species lack recognizable LL-loci except the Ssal_v3.1 Genome-assembly. The data demonstrate an unexpected dichotomy of some leukocyte lineages into LL-positive or LL-negative cell-variants. Such dichotomies suggest exploring differential impacts from the duplicated leukocyte-lineages in health and disease.","Mirushe H Miftari, Tonje B Riste, Bernt T Walther",Fish & shellfish immunology,2024,Compartmentalization; Dual ISH; Innate immunity; LL-Positive leukocytes; Lectocytes; Lectophages; Leukolectins; TECPR-Domains; TRMs; Tectonins,10.1016/j.fsi.2024.109685,"Department of Molecular Biology, University of Bergen, N-5020, Bergen, Norway.; Department of Molecular Biology, University of Bergen, N-5020, Bergen, Norway.; Department of Molecular Biology, University of Bergen, N-5020, Bergen, Norway.

38858074,High-Resolution Fluorespirometry to Assess Dynamic Changes in Mitochondrial Membrane Potential in Human Immune Cells.,"Peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMCs) exhibit robust changes in mitochondrial respiratory capacity in response to health and disease. While these changes do not always reflect what occurs in other tissues, such as skeletal muscle, these cells are an accessible and valuable source of viable mitochondria from human subjects. PBMCs are exposed to systemic signals that impact their bioenergetic state. Thus, expanding our tools to interrogate mitochondrial metabolism in this population will elucidate mechanisms related to disease progression. Functional assays of mitochondria are often limited to using respiratory outputs following maximal substrate, inhibitor, and uncoupler concentrations to determine the full range of respiratory capacity, which may not be achievable in vivo. The conversion of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by ATP-synthase results in a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential (mMP) and an increase in oxygen consumption. To provide a more integrated analysis of mitochondrial dynamics, this article describes the use of high-resolution fluorespirometry to measure the simultaneous response of oxygen consumption and mitochondrial membrane potential (mMP) to physiologically relevant concentrations of ADP. This technique uses tetramethylrhodamine methylester (TMRM) to measure mMP polarization in response to ADP titrations following maximal hyperpolarization with complex I and II substrates. This technique can be used to quantify how changes in health status, such as aging and metabolic disease, affect the sensitivity of mitochondrial response to energy demand in PBMCs, T-cells, and monocytes from human subjects.","Ana P Valencia, Gavin Pharaoh, Arthur F Brandao, David J Marcinek",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2024,N/A,10.3791/66863,"Division of Metabolism, Endocrinology and Nutrition, Department of Medicine, University of Washington; apv4@uw.edu.; Department of Radiology, University of Washington.; Division of Metabolism, Endocrinology and Nutrition, Department of Medicine, University of Washington.; Department of Radiology, University of Washington; Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Washington; dmarc@uw.edu.","Humans; Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial; Leukocytes, Mononuclear; Rhodamines; Adenosine Diphosphate; Oxygen Consumption; Mitochondria; Fluorescent Dyes",T32 AG066574 (NIA NIH HHS); P30 AR074990 (NIAMS NIH HHS); P01 AG001751 (NIA NIH HHS); R01 DK089036 (NIDDK NIH HHS); R01 AG078279 (NIA NIH HHS); P30 DK035816 (NIDDK NIH HHS); K01 HL164761 (NHLBI NIH HHS); P30 DK017047 (NIDDK NIH HHS),Journal Article; Video-Audio Media
38857816,Effects of prolonged application of peracetic acid-based disinfectant on recirculating aquaculture systems stocked with Atlantic salmon parr.,"The use of recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) for Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) production has become increasingly common. RAS water disinfection plays a crucial role on its biosecurity. Peracetic acid (PAA) is a promising disinfectant due to its powerful oxidative properties, broad antimicrobial spectrum, and rapid degradation into no harmful compounds. This study focused on assessing the consequences of prolonged application of a PAA-based disinfectant in a RAS stocked with salmon parr. The experiment included three treatment groups in triplicate: 0 mg/L PAA (control), 0.1 mg/L PAA, and 1 mg/L PAA, using nine-replicated RAS with a total of 360 fish (14.8 ± 2.3 g; N = 40/RAS). The study spanned 28 days, with samples collected on days 0, 14, and 28. The analyzed parameters were water quality, and fish parameters, including external welfare indicators, gill histology, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), reactive oxygen species/reactive nitrogen species (ROC/RNC), oxidative stress biomarkers related to DNA and protein, cellular DNA damage, and global gene expression. While water quality remained relatively stable, there was an increase in bacterial populations in the groups exposed to PAA, particularly 1 mg/L PAA. Fish weight did not differ between the control and PAA-exposed groups. TAC, ROC/RNC, and oxidative stress biomarkers exhibited similar trends. The study identified >400 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the skin, gill, and olfactory organ, with many of these DEGs associated with immune responses. Comparing the transcriptomic profiles of the three tissue organs revealed that the olfactory organ was the most reactive to PAA treatment. This study shows that calculated PAA concentrations of 0.1 mg/L and 1 mg/L in the pump-sump, contributed to an increase of bacteria whereas no detectable differences in health and welfare of salmon parr were found. These findings are promising for the implementation of PAA-based disinfectants in RAS stoked with Atlantic salmon parr.","Junjie Zhang, Maia Eggen, Stefano Peruzzi, Rolf Klokkerengen, Eivind Sundfør, Derrick Kwame Odei, Gerrit Timmerhaus, Alexandros G Asimakopoulos, Trond Peder Flaten, Carlo C Lazado, Vasco C Mota",The Science of the total environment,2024,Differentially expressed genes; Oxidative stress; Peracetic acid; Recirculating aquaculture systems; Salmon parr; Welfare,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.173762,"Department of Chemistry, NTNU - Norwegian University of Science and Technology, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway.; Faculty of Biosciences, Fisheries and Economics, UiT The Arctic University of Norway, 9037 Tromsø, Norway.; Faculty of Biosciences, Fisheries and Economics, UiT The Arctic University of Norway, 9037 Tromsø, Norway.; Department of Chemistry, NTNU - Norwegian University of Science and Technology, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway.; Department of Chemistry, NTNU - Norwegian University of Science and Technology, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway.; Faculty of Biosciences, Fisheries and Economics, UiT The Arctic University of Norway, 9037 Tromsø, Norway.; Nofima AS, Norwegian Institute of Food, Fisheries and Aquaculture Research, 1433 Ås, Norway.; Department of Chemistry, NTNU - Norwegian University of Science and Technology, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway.; Department of Chemistry, NTNU - Norwegian University of Science and Technology, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway.; Nofima AS, Norwegian Institute of Food, Fisheries and Aquaculture Research, 1433 Ås, Norway.; Nofima AS, Norwegian Institute of Food, Fisheries and Aquaculture Research, 1433 Ås, Norway; Faculty of Science and Technology (REALTEK), Norwegian University of Life Sciences (NMBU), 1432 Ås, Norway.

38852037,Predictors of maternal pertussis vaccination acceptance among pregnant women in Norway.,"Maternal vaccination against pertussis is safe and provides effective protection against pertussis for the newborn, but the vaccine coverage rate remains generally low. Norway is currently planning for introduction of routine maternal pertussis vaccination. To assess maternal pertussis vaccination acceptance among pregnant Norwegian women, we surveyed women at 20-40 weeks gestation in 2019. Among the 1,148 pregnant women participating in this cross-sectional study, 73.8% reported they would accept pertussis vaccination during pregnancy if it was recommended, 6.9% would not accept and 19.2% were undecided. Predictors for low likelihood of accepting pertussis vaccination during pregnancy included low confidence in health authorities and in maternal pertussis vaccination safety and effectiveness, low awareness and adherence to influenza vaccination during pregnancy, and low awareness of pertussis vaccination. The major reasons reported for not accepting or being undecided about maternal pertussis vaccination were lack of information on vaccine safety for both mother and child. Most women reported that they would consult their general practitioner or a midwife for information if they were offered maternal pertussis vaccination. General practitioners and midwives were also regarded as the most trustworthy sources of information if the women were in doubt about accepting vaccination. We conclude that information addressing safety concerns and raising awareness about maternal pertussis vaccination could increase acceptance of maternal pertussis vaccination. Our findings highlight the pivotal role of the antenatal and primary health care services in providing such information to pregnant women.","Bo T Hansen, Brita A Winje, Jeanette Stålcrantz, Margrethe Greve-Isdahl",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,2024,Maternal immunization; Tdap; antenatal vaccination; attitudes; maternal care providers; maternal vaccination; obstetrical care; pertussis; pertussis vaccine; vaccine acceptance; vaccine hesitancy,10.1080/21645515.2024.2361499,"Department of Infection Control and Vaccine, Norwegian Institute of Public Health, Oslo, Norway.; Faculty of Health Sciences, Oslo Metropolitan University, Oslo, Norway.; Department of Infection Control and Vaccine, Norwegian Institute of Public Health, Oslo, Norway.; Department of Infection Control and Vaccine, Norwegian Institute of Public Health, Oslo, Norway.","Humans; Female; Pregnancy; Norway; Whooping Cough; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Pertussis Vaccine; Vaccination; Pregnant Women; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Young Adult; Surveys and Questionnaires; Pregnancy Complications, Infectious; Adolescent",N/A,Journal Article

Media coverage of drug side effects can fuel nocebo effects and lead to increased symptom reports. This retrospective observational analysis of emergency reports at the neurological emergency room at University Hospital Essen, Germany, examines whether media communication about a cumulation of very rare cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) after COVID-19 vaccination with the AstraZeneca compound (ChAdOx-1 nCoV-19) was followed by an increase in weekly presentation rates of patients with the main complaint of headache, a symptom commonly occurring as a vaccination reaction but also communicated as a warning symptom for CVST. The rate of headache presentations increased by 171.7% during the five weeks after the first announcement of CVSTs in Germany on 11 March 2021, compared to the five weeks immediately prior. Furthermore, more young women sought consultation for headache, reflecting the communicated at-risk profile for CVST. The increased rate of headache presenters contributed to a 32.1% rise in total neurological emergency cases, causing an increased strain on the emergency facility after the side effect risk was publicized. We discuss a causal role of negative side effect expectations after vaccination with AstraZeneca as a driver for this increase. While transparent communication about benefits and potential side effects is crucial for vaccination acceptance, increased vigilance toward nocebo effects in health-related media communication is needed due to its potential harm to the individual and society, especially when emergency medical resources are stretched thin.","Livia Asan, Julian Kleine-Borgmann, Bessime Bozkurt, Benedikt Frank, Martin Köhrmann, Christoph Kleinschnitz, Ulrike Bingel",Frontiers in psychiatry,2024,COVID-19; emergency care; expectation; headache; media; nocebo; side effects; vaccination,10.3389/fpsyt.2024.1378472,"Department of Neurology and Center for Translational Neuro- and Behavioral Sciences (C-TNBS), University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.; Department of Neurology and Center for Translational Neuro- and Behavioral Sciences (C-TNBS), University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.; Department of Neurology and Center for Translational Neuro- and Behavioral Sciences (C-TNBS), University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.; Department of Neurology and Center for Translational Neuro- and Behavioral Sciences (C-TNBS), University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.; Department of Neurology and Center for Translational Neuro- and Behavioral Sciences (C-TNBS), University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.; Department of Neurology and Center for Translational Neuro- and Behavioral Sciences (C-TNBS), University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.; Department of Neurology and Center for Translational Neuro- and Behavioral Sciences (C-TNBS), University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.",N/A,N/A,Journal Article

Since its recognition as a non-apoptotic cell death pathway in 2012, ferroptosis has emerged as a crucial mechanism in numerous physiological and pathological contexts, leading to significant therapeutic advancements across a wide range of diseases. This review summarizes the fundamental molecular mechanisms and regulatory pathways underlying ferroptosis, including both GPX4-dependent and -independent antioxidant mechanisms. Additionally, we examine the involvement of ferroptosis in various pathological conditions, including cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, sepsis, ischemia-reperfusion injury, autoimmune disorders, and metabolic disorders. Specifically, we explore the role of ferroptosis in response to chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, nanotherapy, and targeted therapy. Furthermore, we discuss pharmacological strategies for modulating ferroptosis and potential biomarkers for monitoring this process. Lastly, we elucidate the interplay between ferroptosis and other forms of regulated cell death. Such insights hold promise for advancing our understanding of ferroptosis in the context of human health and disease.","Fangquan Chen, Rui Kang, Daolin Tang, Jiao Liu",Journal of hematology & oncology,2024,Biomarker; Cancer therapy; Ferroptosis; Human disease; Immunity,10.1186/s13045-024-01564-3,"DAMP Laboratory, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510150, Guangdong, China.; Department of Surgery, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, 75390, USA.; Department of Surgery, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, 75390, USA. daolin.tang@utsouthwestern.edu.; DAMP Laboratory, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510150, Guangdong, China. 2018683073@gzhmu.edu.cn.",Ferroptosis; Humans; Animals; Neoplasms; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Lipid Peroxidation,N/A,Journal Article; Review

38844964,TL1A and IL-18 synergy promotes GM-CSF-dependent thymic granulopoiesis in mice.,"Acute systemic inflammation critically alters the function of the immune system, often promoting myelopoiesis at the expense of lymphopoiesis. In the thymus, systemic inflammation results in acute thymic atrophy and, consequently, impaired T-lymphopoiesis. The mechanism by which systemic inflammation impacts the thymus beyond suppressing T-cell development is still unclear. Here, we describe how the synergism between TL1A and IL-18 suppresses T-lymphopoiesis to promote thymic myelopoiesis. The protein levels of these two cytokines were elevated in the thymus during viral-induced thymus atrophy infection with murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) or pneumonia virus of mice (PVM). In vivo administration of TL1A and IL-18 induced acute thymic atrophy, while thymic neutrophils expanded. Fate mapping with Ms4a3-Cre mice demonstrated that thymic neutrophils emerge from thymic granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMPs), while Rag1-Cre fate mapping revealed a common developmental path with lymphocytes. These effects could be modeled ex vivo using neonatal thymic organ cultures (NTOCs), where TL1A and IL-18 synergistically enhanced neutrophil production and egress. NOTCH blockade by the LY411575 inhibitor increased the number of neutrophils in the culture, indicating that NOTCH restricted steady-state thymic granulopoiesis. To promote myelopoiesis, TL1A, and IL-18 synergistically increased GM-CSF levels in the NTOC, which was mainly produced by thymic ILC1s. In support, TL1A- and IL-18-induced granulopoiesis was completely prevented in NTOCs derived from Csf2rb","Mario Ruiz Pérez, Christian Maueröder, Wolf Steels, Bruno Verstraeten, Sahine Lameire, Wei Xie, Laura Wyckaert, Jelle Huysentruyt, Tatyana Divert, Ria Roelandt, Amanda Gonçalves, Riet De Rycke, Kodi Ravichandran, Bart N Lambrecht, Tom Taghon, Georges Leclercq, Peter Vandenabeele, Peter Tougaard",Cellular & molecular immunology,2024,Cytokine synergy; Emergency granulopoiesis; Thymic GMP; Thymic Neutrophils; Thymus atrophy,10.1038/s41423-024-01180-8,"Molecular Signaling and Cell Death Unit, VIB-UGent Center for Inflammation Research, Flanders Institute for Biotechnology, Ghent, Belgium.; Department of Biomedical Molecular Biology, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.; Molecular Signaling and Cell Death Unit, VIB-UGent Center for Inflammation Research, Flanders Institute for Biotechnology, Ghent, Belgium.; Molecular Signaling and Cell Death Unit, VIB-UGent Center for Inflammation Research, Flanders Institute for Biotechnology, Ghent, Belgium.; Department of Biomedical Molecular Biology, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.; Molecular Signaling and Cell Death Unit, VIB-UGent Center for Inflammation Research, Flanders Institute for Biotechnology, Ghent, Belgium.; Molecular Signaling and Cell Death Unit, VIB-UGent Center for Inflammation Research, Flanders Institute for Biotechnology, Ghent, Belgium.; Molecular Signaling and Cell Death Unit, VIB-UGent Center for Inflammation Research, Flanders Institute for Biotechnology, Ghent, Belgium.; Molecular Signaling and Cell Death Unit, VIB-UGent Center for Inflammation Research, Flanders Institute for Biotechnology, Ghent, Belgium.; Molecular Signaling and Cell Death Unit, VIB-UGent Center for Inflammation Research, Flanders Institute for Biotechnology, Ghent, Belgium.; Department of Biomedical Molecular Biology, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.; Department of Biomedical Molecular Biology, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.; Department of Biomedical Molecular Biology, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.; Laboratory of Immunoregulation and Mucosal Immunology, VIB-UGent Center for Inflammation Research, Ghent, Belgium.; Cancer Research Institute Ghent, Ghent, Belgium.; Cancer Research Institute Ghent, Ghent, Belgium.; Molecular Signaling and Cell Death Unit, VIB-UGent Center for Inflammation Research, Flanders Institute for Biotechnology, Ghent, Belgium.

38827745,Peptides derived from growth factors: Exploring their diverse impact from antimicrobial properties to neuroprotection.,"Growth factor-derived peptides are bioactive molecules that play a crucial role in various physiological processes within the human body. Over the years, extensive research has revealed their diverse applications, ranging from antimicrobial properties to their potential in neuroprotection and treating various diseases. These peptides exhibit innate immune responses and have been found to possess potent antimicrobial properties against a wide range of pathogens. Growth factor-derived peptides have demonstrated the ability to promote neuronal survival, prevent cell death, and stimulate neural regeneration. As a result, they hold immense promise in the treatment of various neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis, as well as in the management of traumatic brain injuries. Moreover, growth factor-derived peptides have shown potential for supporting tissue repair and wound healing processes. By enhancing cell proliferation and migration, these peptides contribute to the regeneration of damaged tissues and promote a more efficient healing response. The applications of growth factor-derived peptides extend beyond their therapeutic potential in health; they also have a role in various disease conditions. For example, researchers have explored their influence on cancer cells, where some peptides have demonstrated anti-cancer properties, inhibiting tumor growth and promoting apoptosis in cancer cells. Additionally, their immunomodulatory properties have been investigated for potential applications in autoimmune disorders. Despite the immense promise shown by growth factor-derived peptides, some challenges need to be addressed. Nevertheless, ongoing research and advancements in biotechnology offer promising avenues to overcome these obstacles.

38818907,The prognostic value of blood cellular indices in pulmonary embolism.,"Prognostication in acute pulmonary embolism (PE) requires reliable markers. While cellular indices such as neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) appear promising, their utility in PE prognostication needs further exploration. We utilized data from the RIETE registry and the Loyola University Medical Center (LUMC) to assess the prognostic value of NLR, PLR, and SII in acute PE, using logistic regression models. The primary outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality. We compared their prognostic value versus the simplified Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (sPESI) alone. We included 10 085 patients from RIETE and 700 from the LUMC. Thirty-day mortality rates were 4.6% and 8.3%, respectively. On multivariable analysis, an elevated NLR (>7.0) was associated with increased mortality (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 3.46; 95% CI: 2.60-4.60), outperforming the PLR > 220 (aOR: 2.36; 95% CI: 1.77-3.13), and SII > 1600 (aOR: 2.52; 95% CI: 1.90-3.33). The c-statistic for NLR in patients with low-risk PE was 0.78 (95% CI: 0.69-0.86). Respective numbers were 0.66 (95% CI: 0.63-0.69) and 0.68 (95% CI: 0.59-0.76) for intermediate-risk and high-risk patients. These findings were mirrored in the LUMC cohort.

38817619,Effects of a Ketogenic Diet on the Assessment of Biochemical and Clinical Parameters in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy: A Preclinical Investigation.,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked recessive disorder characterized by progressive skeletal muscle degeneration and systemic effects, including the central nervous system (CNS). This study aimed to assess the impact of a 14-day ketogenic diet (DCet) on biochemical and clinical parameters in a DMD mouse model. Young adult mice (50 days old) were fed DCet, while control groups received a standard diet. On the 14th day, memory and behavior tests were conducted, followed by biochemical evaluations of oxidative stress, inflammatory biomarkers, body weight, feed intake, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels. mdx + DCet mice showed reduced mass (0.2 g ± 2.49) and improved memory retention (p < 0.05) compared to controls. Oxidative damage in muscle tissue and CNS decreased, along with a significant cytokine level reduction (p <0.05). The protocol led to an increase in hippocampal BDNF and mitochondrial respiratory complex activity in muscle tissue and the central nervous system (CNS), while also decreasing creatine kinase activity only in the striatum. Overall, a 14-day DCet showed protective effects by improving spatial learning and memory through reductions in oxidative stress and immune response, as well as increases in BDNF levels, consistent with our study's findings.","Lilian Leite Fausto, Adriano Alberti, Gabriela Kades, Risoní Pereira Dias de Carvalho, Viviane Freiberger, Leticia Ventura, Paula Dias, Eliton Marcio Zanoni, Ben Hur Soares, Matheus Luchini Dutra, Daniel Fernandes Martins, Clarissa Martinelli Comim",Molecular neurobiology,2024,Central nervous system; Duchenne muscular dystrophy; Muscle; mdx,10.1007/s12035-024-04258-6,"Research Group in Neurodevelopment of Childhood and Adolescence, Laboratory of Experimental Neuroscience, Postgraduate Program in Health Sciences, University of South Santa Catarina, Avenida Pedra Branca, 25, Pedra Branca, Palhoça, SC, 88137-270, Brazil.; Research Group in Neurodevelopment of Childhood and Adolescence, Laboratory of Experimental Neuroscience, Postgraduate Program in Health Sciences, University of South Santa Catarina, Avenida Pedra Branca, 25, Pedra Branca, Palhoça, SC, 88137-270, Brazil. adrianoalberti90@hotmail.com.; University of West Santa Catarina, Joaçaba, SC, Brazil.; University of West Santa Catarina, Joaçaba, SC, Brazil.; Research Group in Neurodevelopment of Childhood and Adolescence, Laboratory of Experimental Neuroscience, Postgraduate Program in Health Sciences, University of South Santa Catarina, Avenida Pedra Branca, 25, Pedra Branca, Palhoça, SC, 88137-270, Brazil.; Research Group in Neurodevelopment of Childhood and Adolescence, Laboratory of Experimental Neuroscience, Postgraduate Program in Health Sciences, University of South Santa Catarina, Avenida Pedra Branca, 25, Pedra Branca, Palhoça, SC, 88137-270, Brazil.; Research Group in Neurodevelopment of Childhood and Adolescence, Laboratory of Experimental Neuroscience, Postgraduate Program in Health Sciences, University of South Santa Catarina, Avenida Pedra Branca, 25, Pedra Branca, Palhoça, SC, 88137-270, Brazil.; University of West Santa Catarina, Joaçaba, SC, Brazil.; University of Passo Fundo, Passo Fundo, RS, Brazil.; Research Group in Neurodevelopment of Childhood and Adolescence, Laboratory of Experimental Neuroscience, Postgraduate Program in Health Sciences, University of South Santa Catarina, Avenida Pedra Branca, 25, Pedra Branca, Palhoça, SC, 88137-270, Brazil.; Research Group in Neurodevelopment of Childhood and Adolescence, Laboratory of Experimental Neuroscience, Postgraduate Program in Health Sciences, University of South Santa Catarina, Avenida Pedra Branca, 25, Pedra Branca, Palhoça, SC, 88137-270, Brazil.; Research Group in Neurodevelopment of Childhood and Adolescence, Laboratory of Experimental Neuroscience, Postgraduate Program in Health Sciences, University of South Santa Catarina, Avenida Pedra Branca, 25, Pedra Branca, Palhoça, SC, 88137-270, Brazil.","Animals; Diet, Ketogenic; Muscular Dystrophy, Duchenne; Mice, Inbred mdx; Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor; Oxidative Stress; Male; Mice; Memory; Muscle, Skeletal; Body Weight; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Hippocampus; Disease Models, Animal",N/A,Journal Article
38817613,Spirituality is associated with immune parameters and disease activity in primary Sjögren's syndrome: a cross-sectional study.,"The role of spirituality in health and disease is a complex and emerging area of research. Incorporating spirituality into the bio-psycho-social model of health and disease leading to the bio-psycho-social-spiritual model provides a more comprehensive framework. In this context, chronic disorders like primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) are of interest due to their intricate interactions between biological, psychological, and spiritual factors. This study explored the relationship between spirituality, immune parameters, and disease activity in pSS patients. Data from 108 patients were analyzed, including self-assessed spirituality (answering to direct questions and completing the Spiritual Transcendence Scale), immunological parameters and disease activity scores. The findings revealed several associations. Individuals with spiritual attitudes or engaged in regular prayer/meditation showed lower serum levels of autoantibodies specific to pSS and lower disease activity scores. Spiritual engagement was also linked to decreased perceived skin and tracheal dryness, suggesting potential benefits for physical symptoms. These findings suggest that spirituality may play a significant role in modulating immune responses and disease activity in pSS patients. The study underscores the importance of considering spirituality as an integral part of the holistic approach to health and disease, further expanding the understanding of the interconnectedness of biological, psychological, and spiritual dimensions.","László V Módis, Zsófia Aradi, Ildikó Fanny Horváth, Péter Pikó, Gábor Papp, Mátyás Osváth, Antónia Szántó, Antal Bugán",Scientific reports,2024,N/A,10.1038/s41598-024-62801-w,"Faculty of Medicine, Department of Behavioural Sciences, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, 4032, Hungary. modis.laszlo6@med.unideb.hu.; Faculty of Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Clinical Immunology, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, 4032, Hungary.; Faculty of Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Clinical Immunology, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, 4032, Hungary.; Faculty of Medicine, Department of Public Health and Epidemiology, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, 4028, Hungary.; PractiWork Plc, Budapest, 1037, Hungary.; Faculty of Medicine, Department of Behavioural Sciences, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, 4032, Hungary.; Faculty of Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Clinical Immunology, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, 4032, Hungary.; Faculty of Medicine, Department of Behavioural Sciences, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, 4032, Hungary.",Humans; Sjogren's Syndrome; Female; Spirituality; Middle Aged; Cross-Sectional Studies; Male; Adult; Aged; Autoantibodies,N/A,Journal Article

Thus, our knowledge of brain-to-gut-to microbiome communication in this bidirectional axis seems to have been overlooked. This review examines the known mechanisms of the microbiome-to-gut-to-brain axis, highlighting how brain-to-gut-to-microbiome signaling may be key to understanding the cause of disrupted gut microbial communities. We show that brain disorders can alter the function of the brain-to-gut-to-microbiome axis, which will in turn contribute to disease progression, while the microbiome-to gut-to brain direction presents as a more versatile therapeutic axis, since current psychotropic/neurosurgical interventions may have unwanted side effects that further cause disruption to the gut microbiome. A consideration of the brain-to-gut-to-microbiome axis is imperative to better understand how the microbiome-gut-brain axis overall is involved in brain illnesses, and how it may be utilized as a preventive and therapeutic tool.","Carolina F F A Costa, Joana Ferreira-Gomes, Fernando Barbosa, Benedita Sampaio-Maia, Philip W J Burnet",Frontiers in neuroscience,2024,behavior; brain injury; gut bacteria; host genes; immunity,10.3389/fnins.2024.1386866,"ICBAS-School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, University of Porto, Porto, Portugal.; Department of Biomedicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Porto, Porto, Portugal.; Laboratory of Neuropsychophysiology, Faculty of Psychology and Education Sciences, University of Porto, Porto, Portugal.; NanoBiomaterials for Targeted Therapies, INEB-Institute of Biomedical Engineering, i3S-Institute for Research and Innovation in Health, University of Porto, Porto, Portugal.; Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.",N/A,N/A,Journal Article; Review

38812512,The protein phosphatase PP6 promotes RIPK1-dependent PANoptosis.,"The innate immune system serves as the first line of host defense. Transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) is a key regulator of innate immunity, cell survival, and cellular homeostasis. Because of its importance in immunity, several pathogens have evolved to carry TAK1 inhibitors. In response, hosts have evolved to sense TAK1 inhibition and induce robust lytic cell death, PANoptosis, mediated by the RIPK1-PANoptosome. PANoptosis is a unique innate immune inflammatory lytic cell death pathway initiated by an innate immune sensor and driven by caspases and RIPKs. While PANoptosis can be beneficial to clear pathogens, excess activation is linked to pathology. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating TAK1 inhibitor (TAK1i)-induced PANoptosis is central to our understanding of RIPK1 in health and disease.","Ratnakar R Bynigeri, R K Subbarao Malireddi, Raghvendra Mall, Jon P Connelly, Shondra M Pruett-Miller, Thirumala-Devi Kanneganti",BMC biology,2024,CRISPR; Caspase; PANoptosis; PP6 complex; PPP6C; PPP6R1; PPP6R2; PPP6R3; RIPK1; TAK1,10.1186/s12915-024-01901-5,"Department of Immunology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, 38105, USA.; Department of Immunology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, 38105, USA.; Department of Immunology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, 38105, USA.; Center for Advanced Genome Engineering (CAGE), St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, 38105, USA.; Center for Advanced Genome Engineering (CAGE), St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, 38105, USA.; Department of Immunology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, 38105, USA.

38807188,Current understanding of the interplay between extracellular matrix remodelling and gut permeability in health and disease.,"The intestinal wall represents an interactive network regulated by the intestinal epithelium, extracellular matrix (ECM) and mesenchymal compartment. Under healthy physiological conditions, the epithelium undergoes constant renewal and forms an integral and selective barrier. Following damage, the healthy epithelium is restored via a series of signalling pathways that result in remodelling of the scaffolding tissue through finely-regulated proteolysis of the ECM by proteases such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). However, chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, as occurs in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), is associated with prolonged disruption of the epithelial barrier and persistent damage to the intestinal mucosa. Increased barrier permeability exhibits distinctive signatures of inflammatory, immunological and ECM components, accompanied by increased ECM proteolytic activity. This narrative review aims to bring together the current knowledge of the interplay between gut barrier, immune and ECM features in health and disease, discussing the role of barrier permeability as a discriminant between homoeostasis and IBD.","Aurora Vilardi, Stefan Przyborski, Claire Mobbs, Alessandro Rufini, Cristina Tufarelli",Cell death discovery,2024,N/A,10.1038/s41420-024-02015-1,"Cancer Research Centre, University of Leicester, Leicester, LE2 7LX, United Kingdom.; Department of Biosciences, Durham University, Durham, DH1 3LE, United Kingdom.; Department of Biosciences, Durham University, Durham, DH1 3LE, United Kingdom.; Cancer Research Centre, University of Leicester, Leicester, LE2 7LX, United Kingdom.

This study aims to explore the latest dietary patterns in Japan following the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on trends in health-promoting food choices. A web-based survey was conducted among 27,154 Japanese adults, selected via quota sampling to mirror national demographics. The study evaluated dietary diversity, measured through the Dietary Variety Score (Outcome 1), and the prioritization of nutritional and health considerations in food selection, assessed via a Likert scale (Outcome 2). Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) and Ordering Points To Identify the Clustering Structure (OPTICS) algorithms were used to delineate patterns in health-centric food selections. OPTICS clustering revealed four distinct clusters for each outcome. Cluster 3, with a diverse diet, comprised older, predominantly female individuals with higher well-being and lower social isolation compared to Cluster 4, which lacked distinct dietary patterns. Cluster 3 also engaged more in snacking, treat foods, home cooking, and frozen meals. Similarly, a divide emerged between those prioritizing dietary considerations (Cluster C) and those indifferent to such aspects (Cluster D). The findings underscore the need for holistic post-COVID-19 public health initiatives addressing socioeconomic and cultural barriers to healthier dietary practices.","Shuhei Nomura, Akifumi Eguchi, Keiko Maruyama-Sakurai, Ruka Higashino, Daisuke Yoneoka, Takayuki Kawashima, Yuta Tanoue, Yumi Kawamura, Rauniyar Santosh Kumar, Takanori Fujita, Hiroaki Miyata",Nutrients,2024,Japan; clustering; dietary diversity; dietary habits,10.3390/nu16101412,"Department of Health Policy and Management, School of Medicine, Keio University, 35 Shinanomachi, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan.; Department of Health Policy and Management, School of Medicine, Keio University, 35 Shinanomachi, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan.; Department of Health Policy and Management, School of Medicine, Keio University, 35 Shinanomachi, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan.; Department of Health Policy and Management, School of Medicine, Keio University, 35 Shinanomachi, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan.; Center for Surveillance, Immunization, and Epidemiologic Research, National Institute of Infectious Disease, 1-23-1 Toyama, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo 162-0052, Japan.; Department of Health Policy and Management, School of Medicine, Keio University, 35 Shinanomachi, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan.; Faculty of Marine Technology, Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology, 2-1-6, Etchujima, Koto-ku, Tokyo 135-8533, Japan.; Department of Health Policy and Management, School of Medicine, Keio University, 35 Shinanomachi, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan.; Department of Health Policy and Management, School of Medicine, Keio University, 35 Shinanomachi, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan.; Department of Health Policy and Management, School of Medicine, Keio University, 35 Shinanomachi, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan.; Department of Health Policy and Management, School of Medicine, Keio University, 35 Shinanomachi, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan.","Humans; Japan; Female; Male; COVID-19; Adult; Middle Aged; Cluster Analysis; Diet, Healthy; Feeding Behavior; Aged; SARS-CoV-2; Young Adult; Food Preferences",NA (Data for Social Transformation),Journal Article

38800200,"Vaccine Hesitancy among Immigrants: A Narrative Review of Challenges, Opportunities, and Lessons Learned.","(1) Background: Vaccination reluctance is a major worldwide public health concern as it poses threats of disease outbreaks and strains on healthcare systems. While some studies have examined vaccine uptake within specific countries, few provide an overview of the barriers and trends among migrant groups. To fill this knowledge gap, this narrative review analyzes immunization patterns and vaccine hesitancy among immigrant populations. (2) Methods: Four researchers independently evaluated the quality and bias risk of the 18 identified articles using validated critical appraisal tools. (3) Results: Most studies focused on vaccine hesitancy among migrants in the United States and Canada, with a higher COVID-19 vaccine reluctance than native-born residents. Contributing factors to this hesitancy include demographics, cultural views, obstacles to healthcare access, financial hardship, and distrust in health policies. Additionally, immigrants in North America and Europe face unfair vaccine challenges due to misinformation, safety concerns, personal perspectives, language barriers, immigration status, and restricted healthcare access. (4) Conclusions: Tailored vaccine education programs and outreach campaigns sensitive to immigrants' diversity should be developed to address this issue. It is also important to investigate community-specific obstacles and assess the long-term sustainability of current efforts to promote vaccination among marginalized migrant groups. Further research into global immunization disparities among immigrant populations is crucial.","Jason Wong, Crystal Lao, Giancarlo Dino, Roujina Donyaei, Rachel Lui, Jennie Huynh",Vaccines,2024,COVID-19; barrier; immigrant; immunization; vaccine hesitancy; vaccines,10.3390/vaccines12050445,"College of Pharmacy, Western University of Health Sciences, 309 E.

38793709,Quantitative and Longitudinal Assessment of Systemic Innate Immunity in Health and Disease Using a 2D Gene Model.,"Dysregulation of innate immunity is deeply involved in infectious and autoimmune diseases. For a better understanding of pathogenesis and improved management of these diseases, it is of vital importance to implement convenient monitoring of systemic innate immunity. Built upon our previous works on the host transcriptional response to infection in peripheral blood, we proposed a 2D gene model for the simultaneous assessment of two major components of systemic innate immunity, including VirSig as the signature of the host response to viral infection and BacSig as the signature of the host response to bacterial infection. The revelation of dysregulation in innate immunity by this 2D gene model was demonstrated with a wide variety of transcriptome datasets. In acute infection, distinctive patterns of VirSig and BacSig activation were observed in viral and bacterial infection. In comparison, both signatures were restricted to a defined range in the vast majority of healthy adults, regardless of age. In addition, BacSig showed significant elevation during pregnancy and an upward trend during development. In tuberculosis (TB), elevation of BacSig and VirSig was observed in a significant portion of active TB patients, and abnormal BacSig was also associated with a longer treatment course. In cystic fibrosis (CF), abnormal BacSig was observed in a subset of patients, and no overall change in BacSig abnormality was observed after the drug treatment. In systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD), significant elevation of VirSig and BacSig was observed in some patients, and treatment with a drug led to the further deviation of BacSig from the control level. In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), positivity for the anti-Ro autoantibody was associated with significant elevation of VirSig in SLE patients, and the additive effect of VirSig/BacSig activation was also observed in SLE patients during pregnancy. Overall, these data demonstrated that the 2D gene model can be used to assess systemic innate immunity in health and disease, with the potential clinical applications including patient stratification, prescription of antibiotics, understanding of pathogenesis, and longitudinal monitoring of treatment response.",Hongxing Lei,Biomedicines,2024,accessible health monitoring; bacterial infection; host response; innate immunity; viral infection,10.3390/biomedicines12050969,"CAS Key Laboratory of Genome Sciences and Information, Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and China National Center for Bioinformation, Beijing 100101, China.",N/A,XDB38030200 (Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences),Journal Article

Over other types of vaccinations like live attenuated or killed vaccines, mRNA-based vaccines have significant advantages. As only a small portion of the pathogen's genetic material is employed and the dose rate of mRNA-based vaccines is low, there is the least possibility that the pathogen will reverse itself. A carrier or vehicle that shields mRNA-based vaccines from the host's cellular RNases is necessary for their delivery. mRNA vaccines have been shown to be effective and to induce both a cell-mediated immune response and a humoral immune response in clinical trials against various infectious diseases (viral and parasitic) affecting the animals, including rabies, foot and mouth disease, toxoplasmosis, Zikavirus, leishmaniasis, and COVID-19.

38783796,The role of interleukin-36 in health and disease states.,"The interleukin (IL)-1 superfamily upregulates immune responses and maintains homeostasis between the innate and adaptive immune systems. Within the IL-1 superfamily, IL-36 plays a pivotal role in both innate and adaptive immune responses. Of the four IL-36 isoforms, three have agonist activity (IL-36α, IL-36β, IL-36γ) and the fourth has antagonist activity (IL-36 receptor antagonist [IL-36Ra]). All IL-36 isoforms bind to the IL-36 receptor (IL-36R). Binding of IL-36α/β/γ to the IL-36R recruits the IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAcP) and activates downstream signalling pathways mediated by nuclear transcription factor kappa B and mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling pathways. Antagonist binding of IL-36Ra to IL-36R inhibits recruitment of IL-1RAcP, blocking downstream signalling pathways. Changes in the balance within the IL-36 cytokine family can lead to uncontrolled inflammatory responses throughout the body. As such, IL-36 has been implicated in numerous inflammatory diseases, notably a type of pustular psoriasis called generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP), a chronic, rare, potentially life-threatening, multisystemic skin disease characterised by recurrent fever and extensive sterile pustules. In GPP, IL-36 is central to disease pathogenesis, and the prevention of IL-36-mediated signalling can improve clinical outcomes. In this review, we summarize the literature describing the biological functions of the IL-36 pathway. We also consider the evidence for uncontrolled activation of the IL-36 pathway in a wide range of skin (e.g., plaque psoriasis, pustular psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa, acne, Netherton syndrome, atopic dermatitis and pyoderma gangrenosum), lung (e.g., idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis), gut (e.g., intestinal fibrosis, inflammatory bowel disease and Hirschsprung's disease), kidney (e.g., renal tubulointerstitial lesions) and infectious diseases caused by a variety of pathogens (e.g., COVID-19; Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae infections), as well as in cancer. We also consider how targeting the IL-36 signalling pathway could be used in treating inflammatory disease states.","Kazumitsu Sugiura, Hideki Fujita, Mayumi Komine, Keiichi Yamanaka, Masashi Akiyama",Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology : JEADV,2024,N/A,10.1111/jdv.19935,"Department of Dermatology, Fujita Health University School of Medicine, Toyoake, Japan.; Department of Dermatology, Nihon University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.; Department of Dermatology, Faculty of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, Tochigi, Japan.; Department of Dermatology, Graduate School of Medicine, Mie University, Tsu, Japan.; Department of Dermatology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.",Humans; Interleukin-1; Psoriasis; Signal Transduction; Skin Diseases,N/A,Journal Article; Review

Observations from animal and human studies indicate that respiratory insults influence the activity of the gut microbiome and that microbial ligands and metabolic products generated by the gut microbiome shape respiratory immunity. Information exchange between these two large mucosal surface areas regulates microorganism-immune interactions, with significant implications for the clinical and treatment outcomes of a range of respiratory conditions, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer.

38780463,Intravital imaging: dynamic insights into liver immunity in health and disease.,"Inflammation is a critical component of most acute and chronic liver diseases. The liver is a unique immunological organ with a dense vascular network, leading to intense crosstalk between tissue-resident immune cells, passenger leucocytes and parenchymal cells. During acute and chronic liver diseases, the multifaceted immune response is involved in disease promoting and repair mechanisms, while upholding core liver immune functions. In recent years, single-cell technologies have unravelled a previously unknown heterogeneity of immune cells, reshaping the complexity of the hepatic immune response. However, inflammation is a dynamic biological process, encompassing various immune cells, orchestrated in temporal and spatial dimensions, and driven by multiorgan signals. Intravital microscopy (IVM) has emerged as a powerful tool to investigate immunity by visualising the dynamic interplay between different immune cells and their surroundings within a near-natural environment. In this review, we summarise the experimental considerations to perform IVM and highlight recent technological developments. Furthermore, we outline the unique contributions of IVM to our understanding of liver immunity. Through the lens of liver disease, we discuss novel immune-mediated disease mechanisms uncovered by imaging-based studies.","Yuting Wang, Felix Heymann, Moritz Peiseler",Gut,2024,IMMUNE RESPONSE; IMMUNE-MEDIATED LIVER DAMAGE; LIVER IMAGING; LIVER IMMUNOLOGY; MACROPHAGES,10.1136/gutjnl-2023-331739,"Department of Hepatology & Gastroenterology, Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.; Department of Hepatology & Gastroenterology, Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.; Department of Hepatology & Gastroenterology, Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany moritz.peiseler@charite.de.",Intravital Microscopy; Humans; Liver; Liver Diseases; Animals,N/A,"Journal Article; Review; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"
38779986,Single-cell proteomics and transcriptomics capture eosinophil development and identify the role of IL-5 in their lineage transit amplification.,"The activities, ontogeny, and mechanisms of lineage expansion of eosinophils are less well resolved than those of other immune cells, despite the use of biological therapies targeting the eosinophilia-promoting cytokine interleukin (IL)-5 or its receptor, IL-5Rα. We combined single-cell proteomics and transcriptomics and generated transgenic IL-5Rα reporter mice to revisit eosinophilopoiesis. We reconciled human and murine eosinophilopoiesis and provided extensive cell-surface immunophenotyping and transcriptomes at different stages along the continuum of eosinophil maturation. We used these resources to show that IL-5 promoted eosinophil-lineage expansion via transit amplification, while its deletion or neutralization did not compromise eosinophil maturation. Informed from our resources, we also showed that interferon response factor-8, considered an essential promoter of myelopoiesis, was not intrinsically required for eosinophilopoiesis. This work hence provides resources, methods, and insights for understanding eosinophil ontogeny, the effects of current precision therapeutics, and the regulation of eosinophil development and numbers in health and disease.","Joseph Jorssen, Glenn Van Hulst, Kiréna Mollers, Julien Pujol, Georgios Petrellis, Antonio P Baptista, Sjoerd Schetters, Frédéric Baron, Jo Caers, Bart N Lambrecht, Benjamin G Dewals, Fabrice Bureau, Christophe J Desmet",Immunity,2024,IL-5Ralpha; Infinity Flow; basophil; eosinophil; eosinophilia; eosinophilopoiesis; hematopoiesis; mepolizumab; reslizumab; single-cell RNA-sequencing,10.1016/j.immuni.2024.04.027,"Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Immunology, GIGA Institute, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Liege, B34 Avenue de l'Hopital 1, 4000 Liege, Belgium.; Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Immunology, GIGA Institute, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Liege, B34 Avenue de l'Hopital 1, 4000 Liege, Belgium.; Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Immunology, GIGA Institute, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Liege, B34 Avenue de l'Hopital 1, 4000 Liege, Belgium.; Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Immunology, GIGA Institute, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Liege, B34 Avenue de l'Hopital 1, 4000 Liege, Belgium.; Laboratory of Parasitology, FARAH Institute, University of Liege, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Avenue de Cureghem 10, 4000 Liege, Belgium.; Laboratory of Immunoregulation and Mucosal Immunology, VIB-UGent Center for Inflammation Research, Ghent, Belgium; Department of Internal Medicine and Pediatrics, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.; Laboratory of Immunoregulation and Mucosal Immunology, VIB-UGent Center for Inflammation Research, Ghent, Belgium; Department of Internal Medicine and Pediatrics, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.; Laboratory of Haematology, GIGA Institute, Faculty of Medicine, Liege University Hospital Centre, University of Liege, B34 Avenue de l'Hopital 1, 4000 Liege, Belgium.; Laboratory of Haematology, GIGA Institute, Faculty of Medicine, Liege University Hospital Centre, University of Liege, B34 Avenue de l'Hopital 1, 4000 Liege, Belgium.; Laboratory of Immunoregulation and Mucosal Immunology, VIB-UGent Center for Inflammation Research, Ghent, Belgium; Department of Internal Medicine and Pediatrics, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium; Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, the Netherlands.; Laboratory of Parasitology, FARAH Institute, University of Liege, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Avenue de Cureghem 10, 4000 Liege, Belgium.; Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Immunology, GIGA Institute, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Liege, B34 Avenue de l'Hopital 1, 4000 Liege, Belgium.; Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Immunology, GIGA Institute, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Liege, B34 Avenue de l'Hopital 1, 4000 Liege, Belgium.

38778224,Bruton tyrosine kinase degrader BP001 attenuates the inflammation caused by high glucose in raw264.7 cell.,"BP001 is a promising small molecule compound that has been specifically designed to target and degrade Bruton's tyrosine kinases (BTK), which is known to play a crucial role in lymphoma development. Macrophages are important immune cells in inflammation regulation and immune response. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of BP001 on RAW264.7 macrophage activation stimulated by a high glucose environment. Our findings revealed that treatment with BP001 significantly inhibited the production of nitric oxide (NO), reactive oxygen species (ROS), interferon-γ (IFN-γ), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in RAW264.7 macrophages exposed to high glucose conditions. Furthermore, we observed that BP001 treatment also down-regulated the expression of BTK in these activated macrophages. To elucidate the underlying mechanism behind these observations, we investigated the phosphorylation level of NF-κB. Our results demonstrated that BP001 treatment led to decreased phosphorylation levels of NF-κB, thereby inhibiting the level of inflammation. In addition, we also found that BP001 could restore RAW264.7 macrophages from the pro-inflammatory state to the normal phenotype and reduce the occurrence of inflammation. The regulatory function of BP001 in autoimmunity is mediated through the degradation of BTK protein, thereby attenuating macrophage activation. Additionally, BTK plays a pivotal role in transcriptional regulation by inducing NF-κB activity. Consequently, it is not difficult to understand that BP001 effectively inhibits inflammation. In conclusion, the present study provides evidence that BP001, a BTK degrader, can serve as a novel immunomodulator of inflammation induced by high glucose, making it an attractive candidate for further investigation.","Jun Lin, Zhendong Chen, Yinying Lu, Hongyu Shi, Pei Lin",In vitro cellular & developmental biology.

The multifaceted influence of IFN-I on brain health and disease sheds light on the complex interplay between immune responses and neurological processes. Of particular interest is the cGAS-STING-IFN-I axis, which extensively participates in brain aging and various forms of neurodegeneration.

38776917,Disentangling the heterogeneity of multiple sclerosis through identification of independent neuropathological dimensions.,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a heterogeneous neurological disorder with regards to clinical presentation and pathophysiology. Here, we investigated the heterogeneity of MS by performing an exploratory factor analysis on quantitative and qualitative neuropathology data collected for 226 MS donors in the Netherlands Brain Bank autopsy cohort. Three promising dimensions were identified and subsequently validated with clinical, neuropathological, and genetic data. Dimension 1 ranged from a predominance of remyelinated and inactive lesions to extensive pathological changes, higher proportions of active and mixed lesions, and foamy microglia morphology. This pattern was positively correlated with more severe disease, the presence of B and T cells, and neuroaxonal damage. Scoring high on dimension 2 was associated with active lesions, reactive sites, and the presence of nodules. These donors had less severe disease, a specific pattern of cortical lesions, and MS risk variants in the human leukocyte antigen region, the latter indicating a connection between disease onset and this neuropathological dimension. Donors scoring high on dimension 3 showed increased lesional pathology with relatively more mixed and inactive lesions and ramified microglia morphology. This pattern was associated with longer disease duration, subpial cortical lesions, less involvement of the adaptive immune system, and less axonal damage. Taken together, the three dimensions may represent (1) demyelination and immune cell activity associated with pathological and clinical progression, (2) microglia (re)activity and possibly lesion initiation, and (3) loss of lesion activity and scar formation. Our findings highlight that a thorough understanding of the interplay between multiple pathological characteristics is crucial to understand the heterogeneity of MS pathology, as well as its association with genetic predictors and disease outcomes. The scores of donors on the dimensions can serve as an important starting point for further disentanglement of MS heterogeneity and translation into observations and interventions in living cohorts with MS.","Alyse de Boer, Aletta M R van den Bosch, Nienke J Mekkes, Nina L Fransen, Ekaterina Dagkesamanskaia, Eric Hoekstra, Jörg Hamann, Joost Smolders, Inge Huitinga, Inge R Holtman",Acta neuropathologica,2024,Factor analysis; Genetics; Multiple sclerosis; Neuropathology,10.1007/s00401-024-02742-w,"Section Molecular Neurobiology, Department of Biomedical Sciences, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.; Neuroimmunology Research Group, Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.; Section Molecular Neurobiology, Department of Biomedical Sciences, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.; Neuroimmunology Research Group, Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.; Section Molecular Neurobiology, Department of Biomedical Sciences, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.; Section Molecular Neurobiology, Department of Biomedical Sciences, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.; Neuroimmunology Research Group, Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.; Neuroimmunology Research Group, Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.; Neuroimmunology Research Group, Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.; Section Molecular Neurobiology, Department of Biomedical Sciences, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands. i.r.holtman@umcg.nl.","Humans; Male; Female; Multiple Sclerosis; Middle Aged; Adult; Aged; Microglia; Brain; Tissue Banks; Netherlands; Autopsy; Cohort Studies; Aged, 80 and over",101078437 (European Research Council); Rosalind Franklin Fellowship (Universitair Medisch Centrum Groningen),"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

Children living in poor urban areas face unique challenges, living far from health facilities and with lower-quality health services, which can impact their access to life-saving vaccines. Our goal was to compare the prevalence of zero-dose children in poor and non-poor urban and rural areas of low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Zero-dose children were those who failed to receive any dose of a diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus (DPT) containing vaccine. We used data from nationally representative household surveys of 97 LMICs to investigate 201,283 children aged 12-23 months. The pooled prevalence of zero-dose children was 6.5% among the urban non-poor, 12.6% for the urban poor, and 14.7% for the rural areas. There were significant differences between these areas in 43 countries. In most of these countries, the non-poor urban children were at an advantage compared to the urban poor, who were still better off or similar to rural children. Our results emphasize the inequalities between urban and rural areas, but also within urban areas, highlighting the challenges faced by poor urban and rural children. Outreach programs and community interventions that can reach poor urban and rural communities-along with strengthening of current vaccination programs and services-are important steps to reduce inequalities and ensure that no child is left unvaccinated.","Thiago M Santos, Bianca O Cata-Preta, Andrea Wendt, Luisa Arroyave, Cauane Blumenberg, Tewodaj Mengistu, Daniel R Hogan, Cesar G Victora, Aluisio J D Barros",Journal of urban health : bulletin of the New York Academy of Medicine,2024,Global health; Health inequities; Poverty areas; Vaccination,10.1007/s11524-024-00859-7,"International Center for Equity in Health, Federal University of Pelotas, Rua Deodoro 1160, Pelotas, RS, 96020-220, Brazil. tmelo@equidade.org.; International Center for Equity in Health, Federal University of Pelotas, Rua Deodoro 1160, Pelotas, RS, 96020-220, Brazil.; International Center for Equity in Health, Federal University of Pelotas, Rua Deodoro 1160, Pelotas, RS, 96020-220, Brazil.; International Center for Equity in Health, Federal University of Pelotas, Rua Deodoro 1160, Pelotas, RS, 96020-220, Brazil.; International Center for Equity in Health, Federal University of Pelotas, Rua Deodoro 1160, Pelotas, RS, 96020-220, Brazil.; Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, Chemin du Pommier 40, 1218, Geneva, Switzerland.; Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, Chemin du Pommier 40, 1218, Geneva, Switzerland.; International Center for Equity in Health, Federal University of Pelotas, Rua Deodoro 1160, Pelotas, RS, 96020-220, Brazil.; International Center for Equity in Health, Federal University of Pelotas, Rua Deodoro 1160, Pelotas, RS, 96020-220, Brazil.",Humans; Infant; Developing Countries; Rural Population; Urban Population; Health Services Accessibility; Female; Male; Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis Vaccine; Poverty; Vaccination Coverage; Immunization Programs; Prevalence,101815/Z/13/Z (Wellcome Trust); OPP1148933 (Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation),Journal Article; Comparative Study
38771075,Pyrroloquinoline quinone: a potential neuroprotective compound for neurodegenerative diseases targeting metabolism.,"Pyrroloquinoline quinone is a quinone described as a cofactor for many bacterial dehydrogenases and is reported to exert an effect on metabolism in mammalian cells/tissues. Pyrroloquinoline quinone is present in the diet being available in foodstuffs, conferring the potential of this compound to be supplemented by dietary administration. Pyrroloquinoline quinone's nutritional role in mammalian health is supported by the extensive deficits in reproduction, growth, and immunity resulting from the dietary absence of pyrroloquinoline quinone, and as such, pyrroloquinoline quinone has been considered as a ""new vitamin."" Although the classification of pyrroloquinoline quinone as a vitamin needs to be properly established, the wide range of benefits for health provided has been reported in many studies. In this respect, pyrroloquinoline quinone seems to be particularly involved in regulating cell signaling pathways that promote metabolic and mitochondrial processes in many experimental contexts, thus dictating the rationale to consider pyrroloquinoline quinone as a vital compound for mammalian life. Through the regulation of different metabolic mechanisms, pyrroloquinoline quinone may improve clinical deficits where dysfunctional metabolism and mitochondrial activity contribute to induce cell damage and death. Pyrroloquinoline quinone has been demonstrated to have neuroprotective properties in different experimental models of neurodegeneration, although the link between pyrroloquinoline quinone-promoted metabolism and improved neuronal viability in some of such contexts is still to be fully elucidated. Here, we review the general properties of pyrroloquinoline quinone and its capacity to modulate metabolic and mitochondrial mechanisms in physiological contexts. In addition, we analyze the neuroprotective properties of pyrroloquinoline quinone in different neurodegenerative conditions and consider future perspectives for pyrroloquinoline quinone's potential in health and disease.","Alessio Canovai, Pete A Williams",Neural regeneration research,2025,N/A,10.4103/NRR.NRR-D-23-01921,"Department of Biology, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.; Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Division of Eye and Vision, St. Erik Eye Hospital, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.",N/A,N/A,Journal Article

38767765,Angiocrine signaling in sinusoidal homeostasis and liver diseases.,"The hepatic sinusoids are composed of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), which are surrounded by hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and contain liver-resident macrophages called Kupffer cells, and other patrolling immune cells. All these cells communicate with each other and with hepatocytes to maintain sinusoidal homeostasis and a spectrum of hepatic functions under healthy conditions. Sinusoidal homeostasis is disrupted by metabolites, toxins, viruses, and other pathological factors, leading to liver injury, chronic liver diseases, and cirrhosis. Alterations in hepatic sinusoids are linked to fibrosis progression and portal hypertension. LSECs are crucial regulators of cellular crosstalk within their microenvironment via angiocrine signaling. This review discusses the mechanisms by which angiocrine signaling orchestrates sinusoidal homeostasis, as well as the development of liver diseases. Here, we summarise the crosstalk between LSECs, HSCs, hepatocytes, cholangiocytes, and immune cells in health and disease and comment on potential novel therapeutic methods for treating liver diseases.","Jinhang Gao, Tian Lan, Enis Kostallari, Yangkun Guo, Enjiang Lai, Adrien Guillot, Bisen Ding, Frank Tacke, Chengwei Tang, Vijay H Shah",Journal of hepatology,2024,Kupffer cells; MASH; MASLD; NAFLD; NASH; alcoholic liver disease; hepatic stellate cells; liver fibrosis; liver regeneration; liver sinusoidal endothelial cells; metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease; portal hypertension; sinusoidal capillarization,10.1016/j.jhep.2024.05.014,"Laboratory of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China; Department of Gastroenterology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.; Laboratory of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China; Department of Gastroenterology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China; Department of Hepatology and Gastroenterology, Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Campus Virchow-Klinikum and Campus Charité Mitte, Berlin, Germany.; Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.; Laboratory of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China; Department of Gastroenterology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.; Laboratory of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China; Department of Gastroenterology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.; Department of Hepatology and Gastroenterology, Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Campus Virchow-Klinikum and Campus Charité Mitte, Berlin, Germany.; Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children of MOE, State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.; Department of Hepatology and Gastroenterology, Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Campus Virchow-Klinikum and Campus Charité Mitte, Berlin, Germany.

38767475,Platelets and inter-cellular communication in immune responses: Dialogue with both professional and non-professional immune cells.,"Platelets, derived from bone marrow megakaryocytes, are essential for vascular integrity and play multifaceted roles in both physiological and pathological processes within the vasculature. Despite their small size and absence of a nucleus, platelets are increasingly recognized for their diverse immune functions. Recent research highlights their pivotal role in interactions with various immune cells, including professional cells like macrophages, dendritic cells, natural killer cells, T cells, and B cells, influencing host immune responses. Platelets also engage with non-professional immune cells, contributing to immune responses and structural maintenance, particularly in conditions like inflammation and atherosclerosis. This review underscores the emerging significance of platelets as potent immune cells, elucidating their interactions with the immune system. We explore the mechanisms of platelet activation, leading to diverse functions, such as aggregation, immunity, activation of other immune cells, and pathogen clearance. Platelets have become the predominant immune cells in circulation, involved in chronic inflammation, responses to infections, and autoimmune disorders. Their immunological attributes, including bioactive granule molecules and immune receptors, contribute to their role in immune responses. Unlike professional antigen-presenting cells, platelets process and present antigens through an MHC-I-dependent pathway, initiating T-cell immune responses. This review illuminates the unique features of platelets and their central role in modulating host immune responses in health and disease.","Puja Kumari, Abhishek Ramachandra Panigrahi, Pooja Yadav, Samir Kumar Beura, Sunil Kumar Singh",Advances in protein chemistry and structural biology,2024,Adaptive immunity; Hemostasis; Immune cells; Inflammation; Innate immunity; Platelets,10.1016/bs.apcsb.2023.12.010,"Department of Zoology, Central University of Punjab, Bathinda, Punjab, India.; Department of Zoology, Central University of Punjab, Bathinda, Punjab, India.; Department of Zoology, Central University of Punjab, Bathinda, Punjab, India.; Department of Zoology, Central University of Punjab, Bathinda, Punjab, India.; Department of Zoology, Central University of Punjab, Bathinda, Punjab, India; Department of Biochemistry, School of Basic Sciences, Central University of Punjab, Bathinda, Punjab, India.

Seniors will be disproportionally affected. The newly released RSV vaccines for those age 60 years and over may reduce the number of deaths for the expected 6000 to 10 000 seniors expected to die from RSV alone. Using a large national survey, we queried Americans over age 60 about their RSV vaccination status and their intention to vaccinate this fall and winter. We found that 9% of seniors had already been vaccinated. Of the remaining unvaccinated, 42% indicated their intent to vaccinate. We found that those with higher levels of concerns for the disease, higher levels of self-assessed risk, believing that vaccines were safe and important, higher levels of trust in health institutions, and men were more likely to seek out vaccinations. Vaccine-hesitant respondents listed a lack of necessity, concerns about side effects and safety, and a lack of information as primary reasons. The large number of unvaccinated seniors will likely lead to an excessive number of hospitalizations and deaths as well as augmented social costs.

By iterative application of spatial transcriptomics and multiplexed single-cell technologies, we identify that the double negative 2 subset of B cells, previously associated with autoimmune diseases, is present in the subepithelial dome in health. We show that in this location double negative 2 B cells interact with dendritic cells co-expressing the lupus autoantigens DNASE1L3 and C1q and microbicides. We observe that in humans, but not in mice, dendritic cells expressing DNASE1L3 are associated with sampled bacteria but not DNA derived from apoptotic cells.

38749420,Naringin: Cardioprotective properties and safety profile in diabetes treatment.,"Flavonoids derived from plants offer a broad spectrum of therapeutic potential for addressing metabolic syndrome, particularly diabetes mellitus (DM), a prevalent non-communicable disease. Hyperglycemia in DM is a known risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), which substantially impact global mortality rates. This review examines the potential effects of naringin, a citrus flavonoid, on both DM and its associated cardiovascular complications, including conditions like diabetic cardiomyopathy. The safety profile of naringin is summarized based on various pre-clinical studies. The data for this review was gathered from diverse electronic databases, including Medline, PubMed, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, Google Scholar, and Emerald Insight. Multiple pre-clinical studies have demonstrated that naringin exerts hypoglycemic and cardioprotective effects by targeting various vascular mechanisms. Specifically, research indicates that naringin down-regulates the renin-angiotensin and oxidative stress systems while concurrently upregulating β-cell and immune system functions. Clinical trial outcomes also support the therapeutic potential of naringin in managing hyperglycemic states and associated cardiovascular issues. Moreover, toxicity studies have confirmed the safety of naringin in animal models, suggesting its potential for safe administration in humans. In conclusion, naringin emerges as a promising natural candidate for both antidiabetic and cardioprotective purposes, offering potential improvements in health outcomes. While naringin presents a new avenue for therapies targeting DM and CVDs, additional controlled and long-term clinical trials are necessary to validate its efficacy and safety for human use.","Hafiza Sidra Yaseen, Hafiz Muhammad Zubair, Adil Jamal, Maryam Farrukh, Reyaj Mikrani, Bushra Shaukat, Jennifer W Hill, Reemal Rana, Ansa Nazir, Muhammad Naveed, Samiullah Malik",Fitoterapia,2024,"Diabetic cardiomyopathy; Naringin, Hypertension; Toxicity",10.1016/j.fitote.2024.106011,"Faculty of Pharmacy, The University of Lahore, Lahore 54000, Pakistan.; Post-Graduate Medical College, Faculty of Medicine and Allied Health Sciences, The Islamia University of Bahawalpur, Bahawalpur, Pakistan.

38740344,The Influence of Probiotic Lactobacilli on COVID-19 and the Microbiota.,"This comprehensive review explores the potential of using lactobacilli as a probiotic in the management of COVID-19. Our findings suggest that lactobacilli show promise in reducing the risk of death, gastrointestinal and overall symptoms, and respiratory failure, as well as in lowering cytokines and inflammatory markers associated with the disease. The molecular mechanisms by which lactobacilli protect against COVID-19 and other viral infections may be related to the reduction in inflammation, modulation of the immune response, and direct interaction with viruses to produce antiviral substances. However, the selected studies demonstrate the presence of mixed findings for various clinical, biochemical, hematological, and immunological parameters, which may be attributed to methodological differences among studies. We highlight the importance of clearly describing randomization processes to minimize bias and caution against small sample sizes and inappropriate statistical tests that could lead to errors. This review offers valuable insights into the therapeutic potential of lactobacilli in the context of COVID-19 and identifies avenues for further research and applications. These findings hold promise for the development of novel approaches to managing COVID-19 and warrant further investigation into the potential benefits of lactobacilli in combating the disease.","Clarissa Reginato Taufer, Juliana da Silva, Pabulo Henrique Rampelotto",Nutrients,2024,Lactobacillus; SARS-CoV-2; bacteria; microbiome; probiotics,10.3390/nu16091350,"Graduate Program in Genetics and Molecular Biology, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre 91501-970, Brazil.; Graduate Program in Genetics and Molecular Biology, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre 91501-970, Brazil.; Bioinformatics and Biostatistics Core Facility, Instituto de Ciências Básicas da Saúde, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre 91501-970, Brazil.",Probiotics; Humans; Lactobacillus; COVID-19; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; SARS-CoV-2,N/A,Journal Article; Review
38737773,The Role of Prebiotics in Modulating Gut Microbiota: Implications for Human Health.,"The human gut microbiota, an intricate ecosystem within the gastrointestinal tract, plays a pivotal role in health and disease. Prebiotics, non-digestible food ingredients that beneficially affect the host by selectively stimulating the growth and/or activity of beneficial microorganisms, have emerged as a key modulator of this complex microbial community. This review article explores the evolution of the prebiotic concept, delineates various types of prebiotics, including fructans, galactooligosaccharides, xylooligosaccharides, chitooligosaccharides, lactulose, resistant starch, and polyphenols, and elucidates their impact on the gut microbiota composition. We delve into the mechanisms through which prebiotics exert their effects, particularly focusing on producing short-chain fatty acids and modulating the gut microbiota towards a health-promoting composition. The implications of prebiotics on human health are extensively reviewed, focusing on conditions such as obesity, inflammatory bowel disease, immune function, and mental health. The review further discusses the emerging concept of synbiotics-combinations of prebiotics and probiotics that synergistically enhance gut health-and highlights the market potential of prebiotics in response to a growing demand for functional foods. By consolidating current knowledge and identifying areas for future research, this review aims to enhance understanding of prebiotics' role in health and disease, underscoring their importance in maintaining a healthy gut microbiome and overall well-being.","Suyeon Yoo, Suk-Chae Jung, Kihyuck Kwak, Jun-Seob Kim",International journal of molecular sciences,2024,human health; intestinal microbiota; microbiota; prebiotics,10.3390/ijms25094834,"Department of Nano-Bioengineering, Incheon National University, Incheon 22012, Republic of Korea.; Department of Bioengineering, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL 61801, USA.; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul 03722, Republic of Korea.; Department of Nano-Bioengineering, Incheon National University, Incheon 22012, Republic of Korea.","Prebiotics; Humans; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Probiotics; Obesity; Fatty Acids, Volatile; Animals; Inflammatory Bowel Diseases",RS-2023-00219213 (Bio&Medical Technology Development Program of the National Research Foundation (NRF)); Research Grant in 2022 (Incheon National University),Journal Article; Review

38729381,A Virus-Inspired Inhalable Liponanogel Induces Potent Antitumor Immunity and Regression in Metastatic Lung Tumors.,"Pulmonary delivery of immunostimulatory agents such as poly(I:C) to activate double-stranded RNA sensors MDA5 and RIG-I within lung-resident antigen-presenting cells is a potential strategy to enhance antitumor immunity by promoting type I interferon secretion. Nevertheless, following pulmonary delivery, poly(I:C) suffers from rapid degradation and poor endosomal escape, thus limiting its potency. Inspired by the structure of a virus that utilizes internal viral proteins to tune the loading and cytosolic delivery of viral nucleic acids, we developed a liponanogel (LNG)-based platform to overcome the delivery challenges of poly(I:C). The LNG comprised an anionic polymer hyaluronic acid-based nanogel core coated by a lipid shell, which served as a protective layer to stabilize the nanogel core in the lungs. The nanogel core was protonated within acidic endosomes to enhance the endosomal membrane permeability and cytosolic delivery of poly(I:C). After pulmonary delivery, LNG-poly(I:C) induced 13.7-fold more IFNβ than poly(I:C) alone and two-fold more than poly(I:C) loaded in the state-of-art lipid nanoparticles [LNP-poly(I:C)]. Additionally, LNG-poly(I:C) induced more potent CD8+ T-cell immunity and stronger therapeutic effects than LNP-poly(I:C). The combination of LNG-poly(I:C) and PD-L1 targeting led to regression of established lung metastases. Due to the ease of manufacturing and the high biocompatibility of LNG, pulmonary delivery of LNG may be broadly applicable to the treatment of different lung tumors and may spur the development of innovative strategies for cancer immunotherapy. Significance: Pulmonary delivery of poly(I:C) with a virus-inspired inhalable liponanogel strongly activates cytosolic MDA5 and RIG-I and stimulates antitumor immunity, representing a promising strategy for safe and effective treatment of metastatic lung tumors.","Junyao Li, Lanqing Luo, Jia He, Jinchao Yu, Xinyan Li, Xueying Shen, Junxia Zhang, Sai Li, Jeffrey M Karp, Rui Kuai",Cancer research,2024,N/A,10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-23-3414,"School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.; School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.; School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.; School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.; School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.; School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.; Tsinghua-Peking Center for Life Sciences, Beijing, China.; Tsinghua-Peking Center for Life Sciences, Beijing, China.; Department of Anesthesiology, Perioperative, and Pain Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.; School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.","Lung Neoplasms; Animals; Mice; Poly I-C; Humans; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Nanogels; Cell Line, Tumor; Female; Administration, Inhalation; Lipids",82173751 (National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); 32241031 (National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); 2023YFC3403100 (National Key Research and Development Program of China (NKPs)),Journal Article

38718316,Impact of maternal immune activation and sex on placental and fetal brain cytokine and gene expression profiles in a preclinical model of neurodevelopmental disorders.,"Maternal inflammation during gestation is associated with a later diagnosis of neurodevelopmental disorders including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, the specific impact of maternal immune activation (MIA) on placental and fetal brain development remains insufficiently understood. This study aimed to investigate the effects of MIA by analyzing placental and brain tissues obtained from the offspring of pregnant C57BL/6 dams exposed to polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid (poly I: C) on embryonic day 12.5. Cytokine and mRNA content in the placenta and brain tissues were assessed using multiplex cytokine assays and bulk-RNA sequencing on embryonic day 17.5. In the placenta, male MIA offspring exhibited higher levels of GM-CSF, IL-6, TNFα, and LT-α, but there were no differences in female MIA offspring. Furthermore, differentially expressed genes (DEG) in the placental tissues of MIA offspring were found to be enriched in processes related to synaptic vesicles and neuronal development. Placental mRNA from male and female MIA offspring were both enriched in synaptic and neuronal development terms, whereas females were also enriched for terms related to excitatory and inhibitory signaling. In the fetal brain of MIA offspring, increased levels of IL-28B and IL-25 were observed with male MIA offspring and increased levels of LT-α were observed in the female offspring. Notably, we identified few stable MIA fetal brain DEG, with no male specific difference whereas females had DEG related to immune cytokine signaling. Overall, these findings support the hypothesis that MIA contributes to the sex- specific abnormalities observed in ASD, possibly through altered neuron developed from exposure to inflammatory cytokines. Future research should aim to investigate how interactions between the placenta and fetal brain contribute to altered neuronal development in the context of MIA.","Hadley C Osman, Rachel Moreno, Destanie Rose, Megan E Rowland, Annie Vogel Ciernia, Paul Ashwood",Journal of neuroinflammation,2024,Autism; Autism spectrum disorder (ASD); Cytokines; Development; Fetal brain; MIA; Maternal immune activation; Neurodevelopment; Placenta; Schizophrenia; Synapse,10.1186/s12974-024-03106-7,"Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, University of California, Davis, Davis, CA, USA.; Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, University of California, Davis, Davis, CA, USA.; Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, University of California, Davis, Davis, CA, USA.; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.; Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, University of California, Davis, Davis, CA, USA. pashwood@ucdavis.edu.","Female; Animals; Pregnancy; Male; Cytokines; Mice; Brain; Placenta; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Neurodevelopmental Disorders; Sex Characteristics; Poly I-C; Transcriptome; Disease Models, Animal; Fetus",R01 HD090214 (NICHD NIH HHS); R21 ES025560 (NIEHS NIH HHS); R21 ES035492 (NIEHS NIH HHS); R01 MH118209 (NIMH NIH HHS); R21 ES035969 (NIEHS NIH HHS),Journal Article
38717832,Vaccine for Targeted Therapy of Lung Cancer: Advances and Developments.,"Considering that lung cancer is a leading global perpetrator, novel treatment approaches must be investigated. Due to the broad spectrum of lung cancer, conventional therapies including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgeries, are not always effective and can have adverse consequences. The present study's overarching objective was to enhance the development of a personalized vaccine for targeted lung cancer therapy. Vaccination functions by eliciting a strong and targeted immune response defense by taking advantage of the specific antigens that are expressed by lung cancer cells. Crucial antigens associated with tumor cells have been identified with the recognition of the genetic and immunological circumstances of lung cancer in this review. The vaccine includes these antigens to prime the immune system, directing it toward recognizing and attacking cancerous cells. In this review, we have addressed the possible benefits of a targeted vaccine strategy, which include a reduction in off-target effects and an improvement in health outcomes for patients. These studies highlight the promise of a tailored vaccine in a novel way for the treatment of lung cancer. The integration of molecular profiling and immunological insights offers a rationale for the design and implementation of personalized vaccines. While challenges exist, the promise of improved treatment outcomes and reduced side effects positions targeted vaccine therapy as a compelling avenue for advancing lung cancer treatment.","Suraj Kumar, Rishabha Malviya, Prerna Uniyal",Current drug targets,2024,Lung cancer; cancer; immunotherapy; patient care.; targeted therapy; vaccine,10.2174/0113894501306103240426131249,"Department of Pharmacy, School of Medical and Allied Sciences, Galgotias University, Greater Noida, U.P., India.; Department of Pharmacy, School of Medical and Allied Sciences, Galgotias University, Greater Noida, U.P., India.; School of Pharmacy, Graphic Era Hill University, Dehradun, India.","Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Cancer Vaccines; Precision Medicine; Antigens, Neoplasm; Molecular Targeted Therapy; Animals",N/A,Journal Article; Review

38715090,"Adiposity, immunity, and inflammation: interrelationships in health and disease: a report from 24th Annual Harvard Nutrition Obesity Symposium, June 2023.","The rapidly evolving field of immunometabolism explores how changes in local immune environments may affect key metabolic and cellular processes, including that of adipose tissue. Importantly, these changes may contribute to low-grade systemic inflammation. In turn, chronic low-grade inflammation affecting adipose tissue may exacerbate the outcome of metabolic diseases. Novel advances in our understanding of immunometabolic processes may critically lead to interventions to reduce disease severity and progression. An important example in this regard relates to obesity, which has a multifaceted effect on immunity, activating the proinflammatory pathways such as the inflammasome and disrupting cellular homeostasis. This multifaceted effect of obesity can be investigated through study of downstream conditions using cellular and systemic investigative techniques. To further explore this field, the National Institutes of Health P30 Nutrition Obesity Research Center at Harvard, in partnership with Harvard Medical School, assembled experts to present at its 24th Annual Symposium entitled ""Adiposity, Immunity, and Inflammation: Interrelationships in Health and Disease"" on 7 June, 2023.

38712374,The immune interactions of gut glycans and microbiota in health and disease.,"The human digestive system harbors a vast diversity of commensal bacteria and maintains a symbiotic relationship with them. However, imbalances in the gut microbiota accompany various diseases, such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) and colorectal cancers (CRCs), which significantly impact the well-being of populations globally. Glycosylation of the mucus layer is a crucial factor that plays a critical role in maintaining the homeostatic environment in the gut. This review delves into how the gut microbiota, immune cells, and gut mucus layer work together to establish a balanced gut environment. Specifically, the role of glycosylation in regulating immune cell responses and mucus metabolism in this process is examined.","Mahmut Demirturk, Mukaddes Sena Cinar, Fikri Y Avci",Molecular microbiology,2024,MUC2; gut immunity; gut microbiota; gut mucosa; inflammatory bowel diseases; mucin glycosylation,10.1111/mmi.15267,"Department of Biochemistry, Emory Vaccine Center, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.; Department of Biochemistry, Emory Vaccine Center, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.; Department of Biochemistry, Emory Vaccine Center, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.",Humans; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Polysaccharides; Inflammatory Bowel Diseases; Glycosylation; Animals; Colorectal Neoplasms; Bacteria; Intestinal Mucosa; Mucus; Homeostasis,R01AI123383 (National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases); R01AI152766 (National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases); R41AI157287 (National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases),"Journal Article; Review; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural"

38705359,What We Know About the Actual Role of Traditional Probiotics in Health and Disease.,"The complex relationship between probiotics and human health goes beyond their traditional function in gut health, generating considerable interest for their broad potential in disease treatment. This review explores the various functions of probiotics, highlighting their impact on the immune system, their benefits for gut and oral health, their effects on metabolic and neurological disorders, and their emerging potential in cancer therapy. We give significant importance to studying the effects of probiotics on the gut-brain axis, revealing new and non-invasive therapeutic approaches for complex neurological disorders. In addition, we expand the discussion to encompass the impact of probiotics on the gut-liver and gut-lung axes, recognizing their systemic effects and potential in treating respiratory and hepatic conditions. The use of probiotic ""cocktails"" to improve cancer immunotherapy outcomes indicates a revolutionary approach to oncological treatments. The review explores the specific benefits associated with various strains and the genetic mechanisms that underlie them. This study sets the stage for precision medicine, where probiotic treatments can be tailored to meet the unique needs of each patient. Recent developments in delivery technologies, including microencapsulation and nanotechnology, hold great potential for enhancing the effectiveness and accuracy of probiotic applications in therapeutic settings. This study provides a strong basis for future scientific research and clinical use, promoting the incorporation of probiotics into treatment plans for a wide range of diseases.

38688639,Toll-like receptors in health and disease.,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are inflammatory triggers and belong to a family of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that are central to the regulation of host protective adaptive immune responses. Activation of TLRs in innate immune myeloid cells directs lymphocytes to produce the most appropriate effector responses to eliminate infection and maintain homeostasis of the body's internal environment. Inappropriate TLR stimulation can lead to the development of general autoimmune diseases as well as chronic and acute inflammation, and even cancer. Therefore, TLRs are expected to be targets for therapeutic treatment of inflammation-related diseases, autoimmune diseases, microbial infections, and human cancers. This review summarizes the recent discoveries in the molecular and structural biology of TLRs. The role of different TLR signaling pathways in inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, digestive diseases, and even cancers (oral, gastric, breast, colorectal) is highlighted and summarizes new drugs and related clinical treatments in clinical trials, providing an overview of the potential and prospects of TLRs for the treatment of TLR-related diseases.","Kunyu Wang, Hanyao Huang, Qi Zhan, Haoran Ding, Yi Li",MedComm,2024,cancer; clinical treatment; disease; innate immunity; toll‐like receptors,10.1002/mco2.549,"Department of Head and Neck Oncology Surgery, State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases & National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases West China Hospital of Stomatology Sichuan University Chengdu China.; Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases & National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases West China Hospital of Stomatology Sichuan University Chengdu Sichuan China.; Department of Head and Neck Oncology Surgery, State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases & National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases West China Hospital of Stomatology Sichuan University Chengdu China.; Department of Head and Neck Oncology Surgery, State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases & National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases West China Hospital of Stomatology Sichuan University Chengdu China.; Department of Head and Neck Oncology Surgery, State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases & National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases West China Hospital of Stomatology Sichuan University Chengdu China.",N/A,N/A,Journal Article; Review
38688619,Evaluation of the Impact of Exposure To Heat and to By-Products of Combustion on the Health of Firefighters.,"Firefighters are often exposed to high temperatures and by-products of combustion, which can affect their health. In this study, we assessed the impact of acute exposure of firefighters in fire simulators. Twenty male firefighters were exposed to fire simulators, and observed in four phases: pre-exposure (group 0, control) and after the end of the first (group 1), second (group 2), and fourth (group 3) weeks of training. Blood samples were collected and dosed to evaluate the response of the immune, inflammatory (C-reactive protein, IL6, and IL10), and endocrine systems (cortisone, total testosterone, free testosterone, SHBG, bioavailable testosterone, TSH, and free T4). In groups 0, 1, and 3, a thermographic evaluation was also carried out to study the temperature and body heat flow of the participants. Regarding the inflammatory process, an increase in C-reactive protein and a reduction in IL-10 were observed. With respect to hormonal markers, an increase in cortisol and reduced levels of free T4 and bioavailable testosterone were found after exposure, with recovery of testosterone levels in the final week of training. Thermoregulatory adaptation of the organism has been associated with changes in heat flow in the organism in people subjected to extreme temperatures, with emphasis on the performance of the lower limbs. Our findings demonstrate an inflammatory response with hormonal changes after exposure to fire and an adaptive response of thermal balance, which could aid understanding of the physiology of the human body in extreme situations.","A C Boggi, J B do Amaral, A L L Bacchi, V M Nascimento, R L Voegels, J M B Dos Santos, G Grimaldi, K Basseto de Oliveira Araújo, V Pavão, D A Passaretti, A Aldred, G Gomes, R Pezato",Annals of burns and fire disasters,2023,firefighter; firefighting; heat; hormones; inflammation; thermoregulation,N/A,"ENT Research Lab, Department of Otorhinolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery, Federal University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.; ENT Research Lab, Department of Otorhinolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery, Federal University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.; ENT Research Lab, Department of Otorhinolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery, Federal University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.; Fire Department, Escola Superior de Bombeiros -- Polícia Militar do Estado de São Paulo, Franco da Rocha, Brazil.; Department of Ophthalmology and Otorhinolaryngology, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.; ENT Research Lab, Department of Otorhinolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery, Federal University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.; Hospital da Polícia Militar, Polícia Militar do Estado de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.; Hospital da Polícia Militar, Polícia Militar do Estado de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.; Fire Department, Escola Superior de Bombeiros -- Polícia Militar do Estado de São Paulo, Franco da Rocha, Brazil.; Fire Department, Escola Superior de Bombeiros -- Polícia Militar do Estado de São Paulo, Franco da Rocha, Brazil.; Predikta Soluções em Pesquisa LTDA, São Paulo, Brazil.; Predikta Soluções em Pesquisa LTDA, São Paulo, Brazil.; ENT Research Lab, Department of Otorhinolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery, Federal University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.",N/A,N/A,Journal Article
38688616,Hormones and B-cell development in health and autoimmunity.,"The development of B cells into antibody-secreting plasma cells is central to the adaptive immune system as they induce protective and specific antibody responses against invading pathogens. Various studies have shown that, during this process, hormones can play important roles in the lymphopoiesis, activation, proliferation, and differentiation of B cells, and depending on the signal given by the receptor of each hormone, they can have a positive or negative effect. In autoimmune diseases, hormonal deregulation has been reported to be related to the survival, activation and/or differentiation of autoreactive clones of B cells, thus promoting the development of autoimmunity. Clinical manifestations of autoimmune diseases have been associated with estrogens, prolactin (PRL), and growth hormone (GH) levels. However, androgens, such as testosterone and progesterone (P4), could have a protective effect. The objective of this review is to highlight the links between different hormones and the immune response mediated by B cells in the etiopathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and multiple sclerosis (MS). The data collected provide insights into the role of hormones in the cellular, molecular and/or epigenetic mechanisms that modulate the B-cell response in health and disease.","Paola Santana-Sánchez, Ricardo Vaquero-García, María Victoria Legorreta-Haquet, Luis Chávez-Sánchez, Adriana Karina Chávez-Rueda",Frontiers in immunology,2024,B cell; autoimmunity; hormones; immune response; lymphopoiesis,10.3389/fimmu.2024.1385501,"Unidad de Investigación Médica en Inmunología, Unidad Médica de Alta Especialidad (UMAE) Hospital de Pediatría, Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Ciudad de México (CDMX), Mexico.; Unidad de Investigación Médica en Inmunología, Unidad Médica de Alta Especialidad (UMAE) Hospital de Pediatría, Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Ciudad de México (CDMX), Mexico.; Unidad de Investigación Médica en Inmunología, Unidad Médica de Alta Especialidad (UMAE) Hospital de Pediatría, Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Ciudad de México (CDMX), Mexico.; Unidad de Investigación Médica en Inmunología, Unidad Médica de Alta Especialidad (UMAE) Hospital de Pediatría, Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Ciudad de México (CDMX), Mexico.; Unidad de Investigación Médica en Inmunología, Unidad Médica de Alta Especialidad (UMAE) Hospital de Pediatría, Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Ciudad de México (CDMX), Mexico.","Humans; B-Lymphocytes; Autoimmunity; Animals; Hormones; Autoimmune Diseases; Cell Differentiation; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic",N/A,"Journal Article; Review; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"
38688598,Effect of exposure to disinfection by-products during swimming exercise on asthma-related immune responses.,"Swimming is a widely practiced exercise in modern society, where there is a heightened interest in health. The exceptional benefits of swimming are well-known, yet the issue of water quality management inevitably arises due to its nature as an aquatic exercise. Several studies reported that chlorine disinfectants commonly used in swimming pool water disinfection could degrade into toxic disinfection by-products (DBPs) and suggested that the DBPs might induce respiratory disorders, including asthma. Conversely, there were also reports that the DBPs had no significant effects on respiratory conditions. In this study, we investigated the influence of swimming exercise and DBPs on asthma. The decomposition products had little effect on the number of T cells in various immune organs. However, swimming exercise was found to increase the cell count in proportion to the exercise duration. Nevertheless, there were no significant changes in other immune cells and the secretion of asthma-related cytokines. These findings indicate that the effects of swimming pool DBPs on respiratory conditions during swimming exercise are either negligible or absent, and instead, the immunological benefits gained through consistent swimming exercise outweigh any potential drawbacks.",Bo-Ae Lee,Journal of water and health,2024,asthma; disinfection by-products; immune response; indoor swimming pool; swimming; swimming pool environment,10.2166/wh.2024.390,"Department of Sport Science, College of Liberal Arts, Dongguk University, 38066 Gyeongsangbuk-do, Gyeongju, South Korea E-mail: balee2240@naver.com.","Swimming; Disinfectants; Asthma; Swimming Pools; Disinfection; Male; Mice; Animals; Humans; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Cytokines",NRF-2021R1I1A1A01059491 (National Research Foundation of Korea),Journal Article
38687064,Comparison of Wealth-Related Inequality in Tetanus Vaccination Coverage before and during Pregnancy: A Cross-Sectional Analysis of 72 Low- and Middle-Income Countries.,"Immunization of pregnant women against tetanus is a key strategy for reducing tetanus morbidity and mortality while also achieving the goal of maternal and neonatal tetanus elimination. Despite substantial progress in improving newborn protection from tetanus at birth through maternal immunization, umbilical cord practices and sterilized and safe deliveries, inequitable gaps in protection remain. Notably, an infant's tetanus protection at birth is comprised of immunization received by the mother during and before the pregnancy (e.g., through childhood vaccination, booster doses, mass vaccination campaigns, or during prior pregnancies). In this work, we examine wealth-related inequalities in maternal tetanus toxoid containing vaccination coverage before pregnancy, during pregnancy, and at birth for 72 low- and middle-income countries with a recent Demographic and Health Survey or Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (between 2013 and 2022). We summarize coverage levels and absolute and relative inequalities at each time point; compare the relative contributions of inequalities before and during pregnancy to inequalities at birth; and examine associations between inequalities and coverage levels. We present the findings for countries individually and on aggregate, by World Bank country income grouping, as well as by maternal and neonatal tetanus elimination status, finding that most of the inequality in tetanus immunization coverage at birth is introduced during pregnancy. Inequalities in coverage during pregnancy are most pronounced in low- and lower-middle-income countries, and even more so in countries which have not achieved maternal and neonatal tetanus elimination. These findings suggest that pregnancy is a key time of opportunity for equity-oriented interventions to improve maternal tetanus immunization coverage.","Nicole E Johns, Cauane Blumenberg, Katherine Kirkby, Adrien Allorant, Francine Dos Santos Costa, M Carolina Danovaro-Holliday, Carrie Lyons, Nasir Yusuf, Aluísio J D Barros, Ahmad Reza Hosseinpoor",Vaccines,2024,health disparities; health inequality; immunization; maternal and neonatal tetanus; vaccination,10.3390/vaccines12040431,"Department of Data and Analytics, World Health Organization, 20 Avenue Appia, 1211 Geneva, Switzerland.; International Center for Equity in Health, Federal University of Pelotas, Rua Mal Deodoro 1160, Pelotas 96020-220, Brazil.; Department of Data and Analytics, World Health Organization, 20 Avenue Appia, 1211 Geneva, Switzerland.; Department of Data and Analytics, World Health Organization, 20 Avenue Appia, 1211 Geneva, Switzerland.; International Center for Equity in Health, Federal University of Pelotas, Rua Mal Deodoro 1160, Pelotas 96020-220, Brazil.; Department of Immunization, Vaccines, and Biologicals, World Health Organization, 20 Avenue Appia, 1211 Geneva, Switzerland.; Department of Data and Analytics, World Health Organization, 20 Avenue Appia, 1211 Geneva, Switzerland.; Department of Immunization, Vaccines, and Biologicals, World Health Organization, 20 Avenue Appia, 1211 Geneva, Switzerland.; International Center for Equity in Health, Federal University of Pelotas, Rua Mal Deodoro 1160, Pelotas 96020-220, Brazil.; Department of Data and Analytics, World Health Organization, 20 Avenue Appia, 1211 Geneva, Switzerland.",N/A,001 (World Health Organization); N/A (Gavi),Journal Article
38686450,Deletion of MGF505-2R Gene Activates the cGAS-STING Pathway Leading to Attenuation and Protection against Virulent African Swine Fever Virus.,"African swine fever virus (ASFV) is the etiological agent causing African swine fever (ASF), affecting domestic pigs and wild boar, which is currently the biggest animal epidemic in the world and a major threat to the swine sector. At present, some safety concerns about using LAVs against ASFV still exist despite a commercial vaccine licensed in Vietnam. Therefore, the efforts to identify virulence factors and their mechanisms, as well as to generate new vaccine prototypes, are of major interest. In this work, we have identified the MGF505-2R gene product as an inhibitor of the cGAS/STING pathway, specifically through its interaction with STING protein, controlling IFN-β production. In addition, immunization of a recombinant virus lacking this gene, Arm/07-ΔMGF505-2R, resulted in complete attenuation, demonstrating its involvement in ASFV virulence. Finally, immunization with Arm/07-ΔMGF505-2R induced the generation of antibodies and proved to be partially protective against virulent ASFV strains. These results identify MGF505-2R, as well as its mechanism of action, as a gene contributing to understanding the molecular mechanisms of ASFV virulence, which will be of great value in the design of future vaccine prototypes.","Sun-Young Sunwoo, Raquel García-Belmonte, Marek Walczak, Gonzalo Vigara-Astillero, Dae-Min Kim, Krzesimir Szymankiewicz, Maciej Kochanowski, Lihong Liu, Dongseob Tark, Katarzyna Podgórska, Yolanda Revilla, Daniel Pérez-Núñez",Vaccines,2024,ASFV; Arm/07/CBM/c2; IFN-β; LAV; MGF505-2R; cGAS-STING; vaccine,10.3390/vaccines12040407,"Careside Co., Ltd., Sagimakgol-ro 45 Beongil 14, Seongnam-si 13209, Gyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea.; Microbes in Health and Welfare Department, Centro de Biologia Molecular Severo Ochoa (CBM), CSIC-UAM, c/Nicolás Cabrera 1, 28049 Madrid, Spain.; Department of Swine Diseases, National Veterinary Research Institute, 57 Partyzantów Avenue, 24-100 Pulawy, Poland.; Microbes in Health and Welfare Department, Centro de Biologia Molecular Severo Ochoa (CBM), CSIC-UAM, c/Nicolás Cabrera 1, 28049 Madrid, Spain.; Laboratory for Infectious Disease Prevention, Korea Zoonosis Research Institute, Jeonbuk National University, 79 Gobong-ro, Ma-dong, Iksan 54531, Jeollabuk-do, Republic of Korea.; Department of Swine Diseases, National Veterinary Research Institute, 57 Partyzantów Avenue, 24-100 Pulawy, Poland.; Department of Swine Diseases, National Veterinary Research Institute, 57 Partyzantów Avenue, 24-100 Pulawy, Poland.; Department of Microbiology, Swedish Veterinary Agency, 751 89 Uppsala, Sweden.; Laboratory for Infectious Disease Prevention, Korea Zoonosis Research Institute, Jeonbuk National University, 79 Gobong-ro, Ma-dong, Iksan 54531, Jeollabuk-do, Republic of Korea.; Department of Swine Diseases, National Veterinary Research Institute, 57 Partyzantów Avenue, 24-100 Pulawy, Poland.; Microbes in Health and Welfare Department, Centro de Biologia Molecular Severo Ochoa (CBM), CSIC-UAM, c/Nicolás Cabrera 1, 28049 Madrid, Spain.; Microbes in Health and Welfare Department, Centro de Biologia Molecular Severo Ochoa (CBM), CSIC-UAM, c/Nicolás Cabrera 1, 28049 Madrid, Spain.",N/A,PID2020-117300RB-I00 (Agencia estatal investigación); ICRAD/I/IFNASF/03/2021 (National Centre for Research and Development),Journal Article

38681946,Investigating Beliefs in Anti-Vax Conspiracy Theories among Medical Students.,"While the doctors' role in immunization is essential, their lack of knowledge or vaccine hesitancy may affect their ability to communicate effectively and educate patients about vaccination, vaccine hesitancy, and vaccine conspiracy theories. This, in turn, may hinder health policy aimed at fighting infectious diseases. Vaccine hesitancy is prevalent not only among the general population but also among healthcare workers; thus, this study is aimed at assessing future doctors' attitudes towards anti-vax conspiracy theories. A total of 441 medical students at Poznan University of Medical Sciences completed a web-based survey designed to explore their attitudes toward the six most prevalent anti-vaccine conspiracy theories. The survey showed that although over 97% of future doctors support vaccinations as an effective form of fighting infectious diseases, and 80% did not believe in any anti-vax conspiracy theory, a significant fraction of 20% of medical students either believed in at least one such theory or were unsure. It has also shown that male and younger students who had not received a flu vaccination and defined themselves as politically right-wing or conservative and religious were more likely to believe in anti-vax conspiracy theories. Our data suggest that, in order to overcome medical students' ambivalent attitudes towards anti-vax conspiracy theories, they should receive more education about the importance of vaccination in preventing disease and about effective ways to combat vaccine hesitancy and anti-vax conspiracy theories.","Jan Domaradzki, Piotr Jabkowski, Dariusz Walkowiak",Vaccines,2024,anti-vax conspiracy theories; attitudes; medical students; vaccines,10.3390/vaccines12040359,"Department of Social Sciences and Humanities, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Rokietnicka 7, 60-806 Poznań, Poland.; Faculty of Sociology, Adam Mickiewicz University, 60-568 Poznań, Poland.; Department of Organization and Management in Health Care, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, 60-356 Poznań, Poland.",N/A,N/A,Journal Article
38680484,Humoral Immune Response to SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Receptor-Binding Motif Linear Epitopes.,"The worldwide spread of SARS-CoV-2 has led to a significant economic and social burden on a global scale. Even though the pandemic has concluded, apprehension remains regarding the emergence of highly transmissible variants capable of evading immunity induced by either vaccination or prior infection. The success of viral penetration is due to the specific amino acid residues of the receptor-binding motif (RBM) involved in viral attachment. This region interacts with the cellular receptor ACE2, triggering a neutralizing antibody (nAb) response. In this study, we evaluated serum immunogenicity from individuals who received either a single dose or a combination of different vaccines against the original SARS-CoV-2 strain and a mutated linear RBM. Despite a modest antibody response to wild-type SARS-CoV-2 RBM, the Omicron variants exhibit four mutations in the RBM (S477N, T478K, E484A, and F486V) that result in even lower antibody titers. The primary immune responses observed were directed toward IgA and IgG. While nAbs typically target the RBD, our investigation has unveiled reduced seroreactivity within the RBD's crucial subregion, the RBM. This deficiency may have implications for the generation of protective nAbs. An evaluation of S1WT and S2WT RBM peptides binding to nAbs using microscale thermophoresis revealed a higher affinity (35 nM) for the S2WT sequence (GSTPCNGVEGFNCYF), which includes the FNCY patch. Our findings suggest that the linear RBM of SARS-CoV-2 is not an immunodominant region in vaccinated individuals. Comprehending the intricate dynamics of the humoral response, its interplay with viral evolution, and host genetics is crucial for formulating effective vaccination strategies, targeting not only SARS-CoV-2 but also anticipating potential future coronaviruses.","Maria E S Monteiro, Guilherme C Lechuga, Paloma Napoleão-Pêgo, João P R S Carvalho, Larissa R Gomes, Carlos M Morel, David W Provance, Salvatore G De-Simone",Vaccines,2024,Ig subclasses; IgA; IgG; SARS-CoV-2; neutralizing antibodies; receptor-binding domain; receptor-binding motif; spike glycoprotein; variants,10.3390/vaccines12040342,"Center for Technological Development in Health (CDTS), National Institute of Science and Technology for Innovation in Neglected Population Diseases (INCT-IDPN), Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro 21040-900, RJ, Brazil.; Center for Technological Development in Health (CDTS), National Institute of Science and Technology for Innovation in Neglected Population Diseases (INCT-IDPN), Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro 21040-900, RJ, Brazil.; Center for Technological Development in Health (CDTS), National Institute of Science and Technology for Innovation in Neglected Population Diseases (INCT-IDPN), Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro 21040-900, RJ, Brazil.; Center for Technological Development in Health (CDTS), National Institute of Science and Technology for Innovation in Neglected Population Diseases (INCT-IDPN), Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro 21040-900, RJ, Brazil.; Center for Technological Development in Health (CDTS), National Institute of Science and Technology for Innovation in Neglected Population Diseases (INCT-IDPN), Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro 21040-900, RJ, Brazil.; Center for Technological Development in Health (CDTS), National Institute of Science and Technology for Innovation in Neglected Population Diseases (INCT-IDPN), Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro 21040-900, RJ, Brazil.; Center for Technological Development in Health (CDTS), National Institute of Science and Technology for Innovation in Neglected Population Diseases (INCT-IDPN), Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro 21040-900, RJ, Brazil.; Center for Technological Development in Health (CDTS), National Institute of Science and Technology for Innovation in Neglected Population Diseases (INCT-IDPN), Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro 21040-900, RJ, Brazil.",N/A,#110.198-13; #SEI21078002021; #SEI26000306611722021 (Carlos Chagas Filho Foundation for Research Support of the State of Rio de Janeiro/FAPERJ); #467.488/2014-2 and #301744/2019-0) (Brazilian Council for Scientific Research (CNPq)); #VPPIS-005-FIO-20-2-51 (FIOCRUZ (INOVA-FIOCRUZ)); #210.003/2018 (Carlos Chagas Filho Foundation for Research Support of the State of Rio de Janeiro/FAPERJ),Journal Article
38678426,The Impact of Immune System Aging on Infectious Diseases.,"Immune system aging is becoming a field of increasing public health interest because of prolonged life expectancy, which is not paralleled by an increase in health expectancy. As age progresses, innate and adaptive immune systems undergo changes, which are defined, respectively, as inflammaging and immune senescence. A wealth of available data demonstrates that these two conditions are closely linked, leading to a greater vulnerability of elderly subjects to viral, bacterial, and opportunistic infections as well as lower post-vaccination protection. To face this novel scenario, an in-depth assessment of the immune players involved in this changing epidemiology is demanded regarding the individual and concerted involvement of immune cells and mediators within endogenous and exogenous factors and co-morbidities. This review provides an overall updated description of the changes affecting the aging immune system, which may be of help in understanding the underlying mechanisms associated with the main age-associated infectious diseases.","Eugenia Quiros-Roldan, Alessandra Sottini, Pier Giorgio Natali, Luisa Imberti",Microorganisms,2024,aging; immunosenescence; infectious disease; inflammaging; vaccination,10.3390/microorganisms12040775,"Department of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, ASST- Spedali Civili and DSCS- University of Brescia, 25123 Brescia, Italy.; Clinical Chemistry Laboratory, Services Department, ASST Spedali Civili of Brescia, 25123 Brescia, Italy.; Mediterranean Task Force for Cancer Control (MTCC), Via Pizzo Bernina, 14, 00141 Rome, Italy.; Section of Microbiology, University of Brescia, P. le Spedali Civili, 1, 25123 Brescia, Italy.",N/A,N/A,Journal Article; Review

The present study aimed to evaluate the inhibitory effect of antigout drugs (allopurinol, febuxostat, topiroxostat, benzbromarone, lesinurad and probenecid) on the activity of the crucial phase I drug-metabolizing enzymes, carboxylesterases (CESs). 2-(2-benzoyl-3-methoxyphenyl) benzothiazole (BMBT) and fluorescein diacetate (FD) were utilized as the probe reactions to determine the activity of CES1 and CES2, respectively, through in vitro culturing with human liver microsomes. Benzbromarone and lesinurad exhibited strong inhibition towards CESs with Ki values of 2.16 and 5.15 μM for benzbromarone towards CES1 and CES2, respectively, and 2.94 μM for lesinurad towards CES2. In vitro-in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE) indicated that benzbromarone and lesinurad might disturb the metabolic hydrolysis of clinical drugs in vivo by inhibiting CESs. In silico docking showed that hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions contributed to the intermolecular interactions of antigout drugs on CESs.

Although the main usage of the vaccine is the prevention of tuberculosis, different works have shown that the effect of BCG can go beyond the peripheral immune response and be linked to the central nervous system by modulating the immune system at the level of the brain. This review therefore aims to describe the BCG vaccine, its origin, its relationship with the immune system, and its involvement at the brain level.","Khiany Mathias, Richard Simon Machado, Solange Stork, Carla Damasio Martins, Amanda Christine da Silva Kursancew, Victória Linden de Rezende, Cinara Ludvig Gonçalves, Tatiana Barichello, Josiane Somariva Prophiro, Fabricia Petronilho",Inflammation,2024,BCG vaccine; Brain; Immune response; Inflammation,10.1007/s10753-024-02018-1,"Laboratory of Immunoparasitology, Graduate Program in Health Sciences, Health Sciences Unit, University of South Santa Catarina, Tubãrao, Santa Catarina, Brazil.; Laboratory of Experimental Neurology, Graduate Program in Health Sciences, Health Sciences Unit, University of Southern Santa Catarina, Criciuma, Santa Catarina, Brazil.; Laboratory of Experimental Neurology, Graduate Program in Health Sciences, Health Sciences Unit, University of Southern Santa Catarina, Criciuma, Santa Catarina, Brazil.; Laboratory of Experimental Neurology, Graduate Program in Health Sciences, Health Sciences Unit, University of Southern Santa Catarina, Criciuma, Santa Catarina, Brazil.; Laboratory of Experimental Neurology, Graduate Program in Health Sciences, Health Sciences Unit, University of Southern Santa Catarina, Criciuma, Santa Catarina, Brazil.; Laboratory of Experimental Neurology, Graduate Program in Health Sciences, Health Sciences Unit, University of Southern Santa Catarina, Criciuma, Santa Catarina, Brazil.; Laboratory of Experimental Neurology, Graduate Program in Health Sciences, Health Sciences Unit, University of Southern Santa Catarina, Criciuma, Santa Catarina, Brazil.; Laboratory of Experimental Neurology, Graduate Program in Health Sciences, Health Sciences Unit, University of Southern Santa Catarina, Criciuma, Santa Catarina, Brazil.; Laboratory of Immunoparasitology, Graduate Program in Health Sciences, Health Sciences Unit, University of South Santa Catarina, Tubãrao, Santa Catarina, Brazil.; Laboratory of Experimental Neurology, Graduate Program in Health Sciences, Health Sciences Unit, University of Southern Santa Catarina, Criciuma, Santa Catarina, Brazil. fabriciapetronilho@unesc.net.",N/A,N/A,Journal Article; Review
38663517,Practices to prevent non-ventilator hospital-acquired pneumonia: a narrative review.,"Nosocomial infection has significant consequences in health care, both at the individual level due to increased morbidity and mortality, and at the organizational level due to increased costs. Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) is the most common nosocomial infection, and is associated with high excess mortality, frequent use of broad-spectrum antimicrobials and increased length of stay. This review explores the preventative strategies that have been examined in non-ventilator HAP (NV-HAP). The management of aspiration risk, interventions for oral hygiene, role of mobilization and physiotherapy, modification of environmental factors, and vaccination are discussed. Many of these interventions are low risk, acceptable to patients and have good cost-benefit ratios. However, the evidence base for prevention of NV-HAP is weak. This review identifies the lack of a unified research definition, under-recruitment to studies, and variation in intervention and outcome measures as limitations in the existing literature. Given that the core risk factors for acquisition of NV-HAP are increasing, there is an urgent need for research to address the prevention of NV-HAP. This review calls for a unified definition of NV-HAP, and identification of a core outcome set for studies in NV-HAP, and suggests future directions for research in NV-HAP. Improving care for people with NV-HAP will reduce morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs significantly.","A Livesey, S Quarton, H Pittaway, A Adiga, F Grudzinska, D Dosanjh, D Parekh",The Journal of hospital infection,2024,HAPNosocomial pneumonia; Hospital-acquired pneumonia; NVHAP; Non-ventilator hospital-acquired pneumonia; Nosocomial infection; Prevention strategies,10.1016/j.jhin.2024.03.019,"National Institute for Health Research/Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Facility, University Hospitals Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.

38654405,Developmental epigenomic effects of maternal financial problems.,"Early-life adversity as neglect or low socioeconomic status is associated with negative physical/mental health outcomes and plays an important role in health trajectories through life. The early-life environment has been shown to be encoded as changes in epigenetic markers that are retained for many years.We investigated the effect of maternal major financial problems (MFP) and material deprivation (MD) on their children's epigenome in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohort. Epigenetic aging, measured with epigenetic clocks, was weakly accelerated with increased MFP. In subsequent EWAS, MFP, and MD showed strong, independent programing effects on children's genomes. MFP in the period from birth to age seven was associated with genome-wide epigenetic modifications on children's genome visible at age 7 and partially remaining at age 15.These results support the hypothesis that physiological processes at least partially explain associations between early-life adversity and health problems later in life. Both maternal stressors (MFP/MD) had similar effects on biological pathways, providing preliminary evidence for the mechanisms underlying the effects of low socioeconomic status in early life and disease outcomes later in life. Understanding these associations is essential to explain disease susceptibility, overall life trajectories and the transition from health to disease.","Cyrielle Holuka, Giorgia Menta, Juan Carlos Caro, Claus Vögele, Conchita D'Ambrosio, Jonathan D Turner",Development and psychopathology,2024,ALSPAC; Aging; DNA methylation; Pace of Ageing; biological pathways; epigenome-wide association studies; financial issues,10.1017/S095457942400083X,"Department of Infection and Immunity, Immune Endocrine Epigenetics Research Group, Luxembourg Institute of Health, Esch-sur-Alzette, Luxembourg.; Luxembourg Institute of Socio-Economic Research (LISER), Esch-sur-Alzette, Luxembourg.; Department of Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences, University of Luxembourg, Esch-sur-Alzette, Luxembourg.; Department of Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences, University of Luxembourg, Esch-sur-Alzette, Luxembourg.; Department of Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences, University of Luxembourg, Esch-sur-Alzette, Luxembourg.; Department of Infection and Immunity, Immune Endocrine Epigenetics Research Group, Luxembourg Institute of Health, Esch-sur-Alzette, Luxembourg.",N/A,N/A,Journal Article

Through interactions between their T-cell antigen receptors (TCRs) and antigens presented by major histocompatibility complex molecules (MHCs) or MHC-like molecules, T cells discriminate foreign and self peptides. Determining the fundamental principles that govern these interactions has important implications in numerous medical contexts. However, reconstructing a map between T cells and their antagonist antigens remains an open challenge for the field of immunology, and success of in silico reconstructions of this relationship has remained incremental. In this Perspective, we discuss the role that new state-of-the-art deep-learning models for predicting protein structure may play in resolving some of the unanswered questions the field faces linking TCR and peptide-MHC properties to T-cell specificity. We provide a comprehensive overview of structural databases and the evolution of predictive models, and highlight the breakthrough AlphaFold provided the field.","Benjamin McMaster, Christopher Thorpe, Graham Ogg, Charlotte M Deane, Hashem Koohy",Nature methods,2024,N/A,10.1038/s41592-024-02240-7,"MRC Translational Immune Discovery Unit, MRC Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, Radcliffe Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.; Open Targets, Wellcome Genome Campus, Hinxton, UK.; MRC Translational Immune Discovery Unit, MRC Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, Radcliffe Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.; Department of Statistics, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.; MRC Translational Immune Discovery Unit, MRC Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, Radcliffe Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK. hashem.koohy@rdm.ox.ac.uk.","Humans; Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell; Adaptive Immunity; Immunity, Cellular; Protein Conformation; T-Lymphocytes; Deep Learning; Models, Molecular; Animals",MC_UU_12010/3 (RCUK | Medical Research Council (MRC)); MC_UU_00008 (RCUK | Medical Research Council (MRC)),Journal Article; Review
38651831,NK-like CD8 T cell: one potential evolutionary continuum between adaptive memory and innate immunity.,"CD8 T cells are crucial adaptive immune cells with cytotoxicity to fight against pathogens or abnormal self-cells via major histocompatibility complex class I-dependent priming pathways. The composition of the memory CD8 T-cell pool is influenced by various factors. Physiological aging, chronic viral infection, and autoimmune diseases promote the accumulation of CD8 T cells with highly differentiated memory phenotypes. Accumulating studies have shown that some of these memory CD8 T cells also exhibit innate-like cytotoxicity and upregulate the expression of receptors associated with natural killer (NK) cells. Further analysis shows that these NK-like CD8 T cells have transcriptional profiles of both NK and CD8 T cells, suggesting the transformation of CD8 T cells into NK cells. However, the specific induction mechanism underlying NK-like transformation and the implications of this process for CD8 T cells are still unclear. This review aimed to deduce the possible differentiation model of NK-like CD8 T cells, summarize the functions of major NK-cell receptors expressed on these cells, and provide a new perspective for exploring the role of these CD8 T cells in health and disease.","Qiulei Wang, Shaodan Chen, Zhenhong Guo, Sheng Xia, Minghui Zhang",Clinical and experimental immunology,2024,IL-15; NK-like CD8 T cell; innate immunity; killer immunoglobulin-like receptors; memory T cell; natural killer,10.1093/cei/uxae038,"Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China.; Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China.; National Key Laboratory of Medical Immunology, Institute of Immunology, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China.; Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China.; School of Medicine, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.","Humans; CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes; Killer Cells, Natural; Immunologic Memory; Immunity, Innate; Animals; Adaptive Immunity; Cell Differentiation; Cytotoxicity, Immunologic",N/A,Journal Article; Review

Importantly, improved understanding of immune contributions to mood disorders has provided novel opportunities for the treatment of debilitating stress-related mental health conditions such as major depressive disorder (MDD). Yet, the impact to, and involvement of, B lymphocytes in the response to stress is not well-understood, leaving a fundamental gap in our knowledge underlying the immune theory of depression. Several emerging clinical and preclinical findings highlight pronounced consequences for B cells in stress and MDD and may indicate key roles for B cells in modulating mood. This review will describe the clinical and foundational observations implicating B cell-psychological stress interactions, discuss potential mechanisms by which B cells may impact brain function in the context of stress and mood disorders, describe research tools that support the investigation of their neurobiological impacts, and highlight remaining research questions.

38648975,Effects of extreme weather on health in underserved communities.,"Increased fossil fuel use has increased carbon dioxide concentrations leading to global warming and climate change with increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as thunderstorms, wildfires, droughts, and heat waves. These changes increase the risk of adverse health effects for all human beings. However, these experiences do not affect everyone equally. Underserved communities, including people of color, the elderly, people living with chronic conditions, and socioeconomically disadvantaged groups, have greater vulnerability to the impacts of climate change. These vulnerabilities are a result of multiple factors such as disparities in health care, lower educational status, and systemic racism. These social inequities are exacerbated by extreme weather events, which act as threat multipliers increasing disparities in health outcomes. It is clear that without human action, these global temperatures will continue to increase to unbearable levels creating an existential crisis. There is now global consensus that climate change is caused by anthropogenic activity and that actions to mitigate and adapt to climate change are urgently needed. The 2015 Paris Accord was the first truly global commitment that set goals to limit further warming. It also aimed to implement equity in action, founded on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. Meeting these goals requires individual, community, organizational, national, and global cooperation. Health care professionals, often in the frontline with firsthand knowledge of the health impacts of climate change, can play a key role in advocating for just and equitable climate change adaptation and mitigation policies.","Sotheany R Leap, Derek R Soled, Vanitha Sampath, Kari C Nadeau","Annals of allergy, asthma & immunology : official publication of the American College of Allergy, Asthma, & Immunology",2024,N/A,10.1016/j.anai.2024.04.018,"Department of Environmental Health, Harvard T.H.

38648183,Membrane-bound ,"Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified a link between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near the MBOAT7 gene and advanced liver diseases. Specifically, the common MBOAT7 variant (rs641738) associated with reduced MBOAT7 expression is implicated in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), and liver fibrosis. However, the precise mechanism underlying MBOAT7-driven liver disease progression remains elusive. Previously, we identified MBOAT7-driven acylation of lysophosphatidylinositol lipids as key mechanism suppressing the progression of NAFLD (Gwag et al., 2019).

38646541,"Granzymes in health and diseases: the good, the bad and the ugly.","Granzymes are a family of serine proteases, composed of five human members: GA, B, H, M and K. They were first discovered in the 1980s within cytotoxic granules released during NK cell- and T cell-mediated killing. Through their various proteolytic activities, granzymes can trigger different pathways within cells, all of which ultimately lead to the same result, cell death. Over the years, the initial consideration of granzymes as mere cytotoxic mediators has changed due to surprising findings demonstrating their expression in cells other than immune effectors as well as new intracellular and extracellular activities. Additional roles have been identified in the extracellular milieu, following granzyme escape from the immunological synapse or their release by specific cell types. Outside the cell, granzyme activities mediate extracellular matrix alteration via the degradation of matrix proteins or surface receptors. In certain contexts, these processes are essential for tissue homeostasis; in others, excessive matrix degradation and extensive cell death contribute to the onset of chronic diseases, inflammation, and autoimmunity. Here, we provide an overview of both the physiological and pathological roles of granzymes, highlighting their utility while also recognizing how their unregulated presence can trigger the development and/or worsening of diseases.","Lavinia Cigalotto, Denis Martinvalet",Frontiers in immunology,2024,cancer; cytotoxic lymphocytes; granzyme; inflammation; wound healing,10.3389/fimmu.2024.1371743,"Laboratory of Reactive Oxygen Species and Cytotoxic Immunity, Department Biomedical Sciences, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.; Laboratory of Reactive Oxygen Species and Cytotoxic Immunity, Department Biomedical Sciences, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.","Humans; Granzymes; Animals; Extracellular Matrix; Inflammation; Killer Cells, Natural",N/A,"Journal Article; Review; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

The potential pro-inflammatory role in their pathogenesis is postulated and Human Endogenous Retrovirus W (HERV-W) is an emerging candidate to modulate this pathogenic finding. HERVs, ancient retroviruses in the human genome, may play roles in inflammation and disease pathogenesis. Despite HERVs' involvement in autoimmune diseases, their influence on mental disorders remains underexplored. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the level of HERV-W-env expression and the systemic inflammatory profile through the concentration of IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α and INF-γ cytokines in BD and SZ patients.","Sara Coelho Rangel, Michelly Damasceno da Silva, Décio Gilberto Natrielli Filho, Samuel Nascimento Santos, Jonatas Bussador do Amaral, Jefferson Russo Victor, Kevin Cezar Nascimento Silva, Izabela Dorota Tuleta, Carolina Nunes França, Marina Tiemi Shio, Lucas Melo Neves, André Luis Lacerda Bachi, Luiz Henrique da Silva Nali",Retrovirology,2024,Bipolar Disorder; Cytokines; Expression; Human Endogenous Retrovirus; Inflammation; Schizophrenia,10.1186/s12977-024-00640-3,"Post-graduation Program in Health Sciences, Santo Amaro University, Rua Isabel Schmitt, 540, São Paulo, Brazil.; Post-graduation Program in Health Sciences, Santo Amaro University, Rua Isabel Schmitt, 540, São Paulo, Brazil.; Hospital Escola Wladimir Arruda- Departamento de Psiquiatria- Santo Amaro University, Rua Prof. Enéas de Siqueira Neto, 340, São Paulo, Brazil.; Post-graduation Program in Health Sciences, Santo Amaro University, Rua Isabel Schmitt, 540, São Paulo, Brazil.; Ent Research Lab, Department of Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Federal University of Sao Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.; Post-graduation Program in Health Sciences, Santo Amaro University, Rua Isabel Schmitt, 540, São Paulo, Brazil.; Post-graduation Program in Health Sciences, Santo Amaro University, Rua Isabel Schmitt, 540, São Paulo, Brazil.; Department of Medicine-Cardiology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, EUA, USA.; Post-graduation Program in Health Sciences, Santo Amaro University, Rua Isabel Schmitt, 540, São Paulo, Brazil.; Post-graduation Program in Health Sciences, Santo Amaro University, Rua Isabel Schmitt, 540, São Paulo, Brazil.; Post-graduation Program in Health Sciences, Santo Amaro University, Rua Isabel Schmitt, 540, São Paulo, Brazil.; Post-graduation Program in Health Sciences, Santo Amaro University, Rua Isabel Schmitt, 540, São Paulo, Brazil.; Post-graduation Program in Health Sciences, Santo Amaro University, Rua Isabel Schmitt, 540, São Paulo, Brazil. luiznali@gmail.com.",Humans; Schizophrenia; Bipolar Disorder; Endogenous Retroviruses; Male; Adult; Female; Cytokines; Up-Regulation; Middle Aged; Inflammation; Interleukin-10; Interferon-gamma; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha; Young Adult,#2023/08773-0 and #2022/07567-5 (Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo); #2023/08773-0 and #2022/07567-5 (Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo); #2023/08773-0 and #2022/07567-5 (Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo),"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

They regulate innate immunity by triggering a protective inflammatory response. However, despite their protective role, aberrant NLPR inflammasome activation and gain-of-function mutations in NLRP sensor proteins are involved in occurrence and enhancement of non-communicating autoimmune, auto-inflammatory, and neurodegenerative diseases. In the last few years, significant advances have been achieved in the understanding of the NLRP inflammasome physiological functions and their molecular mechanisms of activation, as well as therapeutics that target NLRP inflammasome activity in inflammatory diseases. Here, we provide the latest research progress on NLRP inflammasomes, including NLRP1, CARD8, NLRP3, NLRP6, NLRP7, NLRP2, NLRP9, NLRP10, and NLRP12 regarding their structural and assembling features, signaling transduction and molecular activation mechanisms. Importantly, we highlight the mechanisms associated with NLRP inflammasome dysregulation involved in numerous human auto-inflammatory, autoimmune, and neurodegenerative diseases. Overall, we summarize the latest discoveries in NLRP biology, their forming inflammasomes, and their role in health and diseases, and provide therapeutic strategies and perspectives for future studies about NLRP inflammasomes.","Zhihao Xu, Arnaud John Kombe Kombe, Shasha Deng, Hongliang Zhang, Songquan Wu, Jianbin Ruan, Ying Zhou, Tengchuan Jin",Molecular biomedicine,2024,Auto-inflammatory; Autoimmune; Health and disease; NLRP inflammasome; Neurological disorders; Therapeutic inhibitor,10.1186/s43556-024-00179-x,"Center of Disease Immunity and Intervention, College of Medicine, Lishui University, Lishui, 323000, China.; Laboratory of Structural Immunology, the CAS Key Laboratory of Innate Immunity and Chronic Disease, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, 230027, China.; Laboratory of Structural Immunology, the CAS Key Laboratory of Innate Immunity and Chronic Disease, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, 230027, China.; Center of Disease Immunity and Intervention, College of Medicine, Lishui University, Lishui, 323000, China.; Center of Disease Immunity and Intervention, College of Medicine, Lishui University, Lishui, 323000, China.; Department of Immunology, University of Connecticut Health Center, Farmington, 06030, USA. ruan@uchc.edu.; Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Core Facility Center, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, 230001, Anhui, China. caddiezy@ustc.edu.cn.; Center of Disease Immunity and Intervention, College of Medicine, Lishui University, Lishui, 323000, China. jint@ustc.edu.cn.","Humans; Inflammasomes; NLR Proteins; Animals; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Signal Transduction; Immunity, Innate; Autoimmune Diseases; Inflammation; Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing",2022YFC2304102 (Key Technologies Research and Development Program); 31971129 (National Natural Science Foundation of China); 82272301 (National Natural Science Foundation of China); 2022i01020025 (Anhui Provincial Key Research and Development Project); WK9100000001 (Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"Journal Article; Review; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

38635851,Bayesian modeling of post-vaccination serological data suggests that yearly vaccination of dog aged <2 years old is efficient to stop rabies circulation in Cambodia.,"Rabies control remains challenging in low and middle-income countries, mostly due to lack of financial resources, rapid turnover of dog populations and poor accessibility to dogs. Rabies is endemic in Cambodia, where no national rabies vaccination program is implemented. The objective of this study was to assess the short and long-term vaccination-induced immunity in Cambodian dogs under field conditions, and to propose optimized vaccination strategies. A cohort of 351 dogs was followed at regular time points following primary vaccination only (PV) or PV plus single booster (BV). Fluorescent antibody virus neutralization test (FAVNT) was implemented to determine the neutralizing antibody titer against rabies and an individual titer ≥0·5 IU/mL indicated protection. Bayesian modeling was used to evaluate the individual duration of protection against rabies and the efficacy of two different vaccination strategies. Overall, 61% of dogs had a protective immunity one year after PV. In dogs receiving a BV, this protective immunity remained for up to one year after the BV in 95% of dogs. According to the best Bayesian model, a PV conferred a protective immunity in 82% of dogs (95% CI: 75-91%) for a mean duration of 4.7 years, and BV induced a lifelong protective immunity. Annual PV of dogs less than one year old and systematic BV solely of dogs vaccinated the year before would allow to achieve the 70% World Health Organization recommended threshold to control rabies circulation in a dog population in three to five years of implementation depending on dog population dynamics. This vaccination strategy would save up to about a third of vaccine doses, reducing cost and time efforts of mass dog vaccination campaigns. These results can contribute to optimize rabies control measures in Cambodia moving towards the global goal of ending human death from dog-mediated rabies by 2030.","Heidi Auerswald, Julia Guillebaud, Benoit Durand, Mathilde Le Vu, Sopheak Sorn, Saraden In, Vutha Pov, Holl Davun, Veasna Duong, Sowath Ly, Philippe Dussart, Véronique Chevalier",PLoS neglected tropical diseases,2024,N/A,10.1371/journal.pntd.0012089,"Virology Unit, Institut Pasteur du Cambodge, Pasteur Network, Phnom Penh, Cambodia.; Virology Unit, Institut Pasteur du Cambodge, Pasteur Network, Phnom Penh, Cambodia.; Epidemiology Unit, Laboratory for Animal Health, French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety (ANSES), University Paris-Est, Maisons-Alfort, France.; Epidemiology and Public Health Unit, Institut Pasteur du Cambodge, Pasteur Network, Phnom Penh, Cambodia.; Epidemiology and Public Health Unit, Institut Pasteur du Cambodge, Pasteur Network, Phnom Penh, Cambodia.; Virology Unit, Institut Pasteur du Cambodge, Pasteur Network, Phnom Penh, Cambodia.; Epidemiology and Public Health Unit, Institut Pasteur du Cambodge, Pasteur Network, Phnom Penh, Cambodia.; General Directorate of Animal Health and Production, Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Phnom Penh, Cambodia.; Virology Unit, Institut Pasteur du Cambodge, Pasteur Network, Phnom Penh, Cambodia.; Epidemiology and Public Health Unit, Institut Pasteur du Cambodge, Pasteur Network, Phnom Penh, Cambodia.; Virology Unit, Institut Pasteur du Cambodge, Pasteur Network, Phnom Penh, Cambodia.; Epidemiology and Public Health Unit, Institut Pasteur du Cambodge, Pasteur Network, Phnom Penh, Cambodia.","Dogs; Animals; Rabies; Cambodia; Rabies Vaccines; Dog Diseases; Bayes Theorem; Antibodies, Viral; Vaccination; Male; Female; Antibodies, Neutralizing; Rabies virus",N/A,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

38630620,Mast cells: a novel therapeutic avenue for cardiovascular diseases?,"Mast cells are tissue-resident immune cells strategically located in different compartments of the normal human heart (the myocardium, pericardium, aortic valve, and close to nerves) as well as in atherosclerotic plaques. Cardiac mast cells produce a broad spectrum of vasoactive and proinflammatory mediators, which have potential roles in inflammation, angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis, tissue remodelling, and fibrosis. Mast cells release preformed mediators (e.g. histamine, tryptase, and chymase) and de novo synthesized mediators (e.g. cysteinyl leukotriene C4 and prostaglandin D2), as well as cytokines and chemokines, which can activate different resident immune cells (e.g. macrophages) and structural cells (e.g. fibroblasts and endothelial cells) in the human heart and aorta. The transcriptional profiles of various mast cell populations highlight their potential heterogeneity and distinct gene and proteome expression. Mast cell plasticity and heterogeneity enable these cells the potential for performing different, even opposite, functions in response to changing tissue contexts. Human cardiac mast cells display significant differences compared with mast cells isolated from other organs. These characteristics make cardiac mast cells intriguing, given their dichotomous potential roles of inducing or protecting against cardiovascular diseases. Identification of cardiac mast cell subpopulations represents a prerequisite for understanding their potential multifaceted roles in health and disease. Several new drugs specifically targeting human mast cell activation are under development or in clinical trials. Mast cells and/or their subpopulations can potentially represent novel therapeutic targets for cardiovascular disorders.","Remo Poto, Gianni Marone, Stephen J Galli, Gilda Varricchi",Cardiovascular research,2024,Allergy; Atherosclerosis; Cardiovascular diseases; Heart failure; Mast cells; Myocardial infarction; Myocarditis,10.1093/cvr/cvae066,"Department of Translational Medical Sciences, University of Naples Federico II, Via S.

38629573,Nonstructural barriers to adult vaccination.,"Adult vaccination coverage remains low, despite vaccine recommendations, improved access, and reimbursement. Low vaccination coverage and an aging population at higher risk from vaccine-preventable diseases lead to preventable disability and deaths, straining healthcare systems. An Advisory Board meeting was, therefore, held to identify non-structural barriers to adult vaccination and discuss potential solutions to increase uptake. Many non-structural factors can influence vaccine uptake, such as heterogeneity in the population, (fear of) vaccine shortages, incentives, or mandates for vaccination, understanding of disease burden and personal risks, time and opportunity for healthcare providers (HCPs) to discuss and deliver vaccines during general practice or hospital visits, trust in the health system, and education. To address these barriers, push-pull mechanisms are required: to pull patients in for vaccination and to push HCP performance on vaccination delivery. For patients, the focus should be on lifelong prevention and quality of life benefits: personal conversations are needed to increase confidence and knowledge about vaccination, and credible communication is required to build trust in health services and normalize vaccination. For providers, quality measurements are required to prioritize vaccination and ensure opportunities to check vaccination status, discuss and deliver vaccines are not missed. Financial and quality-based incentives may help increase uptake.","T Mark Doherty, Fiona Ecarnot, Jacques Gaillat, Lois Privor-Dumm",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,2024,Adult; barriers; drivers; trust; vaccination,10.1080/21645515.2024.2334475,"GSK, Copenhagen, Denmark.; University of Franche-Comte, Besançon, France.; Centre Hospitalier Annecy, Annecy, France.; Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, USA.",Adult; Humans; Aged; Quality of Life; Vaccines; Vaccination; Vaccination Coverage; Health Personnel,N/A,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

38626403,Neuroimmunophysiology of the gastrointestinal tract.,"Gut physiology is the epicenter of a web of internal communication systems (i.e., neural, immune, hormonal) mediated by cell-cell contacts, soluble factors, and external influences, such as the microbiome, diet, and the physical environment. Together these provide the signals that shape enteric homeostasis and, when they go awry, lead to disease. Faced with the seemingly paradoxical tasks of nutrient uptake (digestion) and retarding pathogen invasion (host defense), the gut integrates interactions between a variety of cells and signaling molecules to keep the host nourished and protected from pathogens. When the system fails, the outcome can be acute or chronic disease, often labeled as ""idiopathic"" in nature (e.g., irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease). Here we underscore the importance of a holistic approach to gut physiology, placing an emphasis on intercellular connectedness, using enteric neuroimmunophysiology as the paradigm. The goal of this opinion piece is to acknowledge the pace of change brought to our field via single-cell and -omic methodologies and other techniques such as cell lineage tracing, transgenic animal models, methods for culturing patient tissue, and advanced imaging. We identify gaps in the field and hope to inspire and challenge colleagues to take up the mantle and advance awareness of the subtleties, intricacies, and nuances of intestinal physiology in health and disease by defining communication pathways between gut resident cells, those recruited from the circulation, and ""external"" influences such as the central nervous system and the gut microbiota.","Derek M McKay, Manon Defaye, Sruthi Rajeev, Wallace K MacNaughton, Yasmin Nasser, Keith A Sharkey",American journal of physiology.

38623070,Distinct members of the Caenorhabditis elegans CeMbio reference microbiota exert cryptic virulence that is masked by host defense.,"Microbiotas are complex microbial communities that colonize specific niches in the host and provide essential organismal functions that are important in health and disease. Understanding the ability of each distinct community member to promote or impair host health, alone or in the context of the community, is imperative for understanding how differences in community structure affect host health and vice versa. Recently, a reference 12-member microbiota for the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans, known as CeMbio, was defined. Here, we show the differential ability of each CeMbio bacterial species to activate innate immunity through the conserved PMK-1/p38 MAPK, ACh-WNT, and HLH-30/TFEB pathways. Although distinct CeMbio members differed in their ability to activate the PMK-1/p38 pathway, the ability to do so did not correlate with bacterial-induced lifespan reduction in wild-type or immunodeficient animals. In contrast, most species activated HLH-30/TFEB and showed virulence toward hlh-30-deficient animals. These results suggest that the microbiota of C. elegans is rife with bacteria that can shorten the host's lifespan if host defense is compromised and that HLH-30/TFEB is a fundamental and key host protective factor.","Xavier Gonzalez, Javier E Irazoqui",Molecular microbiology,2024,C. elegans; MAPK; TFEB; Wnt; cryptic virulence; gene expression; host defense; innate immunity; intestine; microbiota,10.1111/mmi.15258,"Immunology and Microbiology Graduate Program, Morningside Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts, USA.; Department of Microbiology and Physiological Systems, University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts, USA.","Animals; Caenorhabditis elegans; Microbiota; Virulence; Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins; Immunity, Innate; Bacteria; p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; Transcription Factors; Longevity; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors",R35GM149284 (NIGMS NIH HHS); T32 AI095213 (NIAID NIH HHS); P40 OD010440 (NIH HHS); R01GM101056 (NIGMS NIH HHS); R25GM113686 (NIGMS NIH HHS); R21 AI169842 (NIAID NIH HHS); R01 GM101056 (NIGMS NIH HHS); R25 GM113686 (NIGMS NIH HHS); R35 GM149284 (NIGMS NIH HHS); R21AI169842 (National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases); T32AI095213 (National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases); R01GM101056 (NIGMS NIH HHS); R25GM113686 (NIGMS NIH HHS); R35GM149284 (NIGMS NIH HHS); P40OD010440 (NIH Office of Research Infrastructure Programs),"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural"
38622400,Isolation and Single-Cell Transcriptomic Analysis of Murine Regulatory B Cells.,"Regulatory B (Breg) cells have been demonstrated to play an important role in the inhibition of a wide range of immunological responses, and they are absent or malfunction in autoimmune diseases like lupus. Breg cells can control immunological responses and keep the immune system in a balanced state by releasing immunosuppressive cytokines such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) and interleukin-10 (IL-10), which in turn promote regulatory T (Treg) cells and reduce effector T cell responses. Breg cells have also been linked to the modulation of cancer immunity. Due to their immunosuppressive role, in the context of cancer, Breg cells aid in tumor immune evasion and promote tumor progression. Nonetheless, it has been established that Breg cells are involved in both cancer immunity and autoimmunity, and their characterizations beyond surface markers, for example, on the transcriptomic level, are essential for our understanding of Breg biology in health and disease. In this chapter, using lupus-prone MRL/lpr mice, we describe a Breg cell isolation protocol for the purpose of single-cell RNA sequencing analysis.","Razan M Alajoleen, Liwu Li, Xin M Luo","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2024,Autoimmune disease; Cancer; Regulatory B cells; Single-cell RNA sequencing,10.1007/978-1-0716-3754-8_12,"Department of Biomedical Sciences and Pathobiology, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA.; Department of Biological Sciences, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA.; Department of Biomedical Sciences and Pathobiology, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA. xinluo@vt.edu.","Animals; Mice; B-Lymphocytes, Regulatory; Mice, Inbred MRL lpr; Cytokines; Transforming Growth Factor beta; T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory; Autoimmune Diseases; Neoplasms",N/A,Journal Article

Isolation of MAMs from endothelial cells is vital for studying insight into the immune regulation of many inflammatory diseases. Endothelial cells (ECs) are critical innate immune cells due to their paracrine function of secreting interleukins, chemokines, cytokines, and growth factors, as well as expressing levels of pattern recognition receptors including toll-like receptors (TLRs). Furthermore, ECs regulate and recruit monocytes by expressing adhesion molecules including vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), P-selectin, and E-selectin, to facilitate monocyte diapedesis in areas of damage and inflammation. This protocol consists of step-by-step instructions on isolating pure MAMs and other subcellular fractions from endothelial cells, which is critical to understanding ER and mitochondria crosstalks in endothelial functions in health and disease.","Margaret Baldini, Cheng Zhang, Jun Yu","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2024,Endoplasmic reticulum; Endothelial cells; Immunity; Inflammation; Mitochondria; Mitochondria-associated membranes; Subcellular fractions,10.1007/978-1-0716-3754-8_8,"Department of Cardiovascular Sciences and Center for Metabolic Disease Research, Temple University Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA.; Department of Cardiovascular Sciences and Center for Metabolic Disease Research, Temple University Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA.; Department of Cardiovascular Sciences and Center for Metabolic Disease Research, Temple University Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA. jun.yu@temple.edu.",Humans; Endothelial Cells; Mitochondria Associated Membranes; Mitochondria; Inflammation; Povidone; Silicon Dioxide,N/A,Journal Article

Different populations of thymic stromal cells interact with T cells, thereby controlling the dynamic development of T cells through their differentiation and function. Proteostasis represents a balance between protein expression, folding, and modification and protein clearance, and its fluctuation usually depends at least partially on related protein regulatory systems for further survival and effects. However, in terms of the substantial requirement for self-antigens and their processing burden, increasing evidence highlights that protein regulation contributes to the physiological effects of thymic stromal cells. Impaired proteostasis may expedite the progression of thymic involution and dysfunction, accompanied by the development of autoimmune diseases or thymoma. Hence, in this review, we summarize the regulation of proteostasis within different types of thymic stromal cells under physiological and pathological conditions to identify potential targets for thymic regeneration and immunotherapy.","Ting Liu, Sheng Xia",The protein journal,2024,Autoimmune disease; Proteostasis; Thymic stromal cell; Thymoma; thymus,10.1007/s10930-024-10197-x,"Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Jiangsu University, 301, Xuefu Road, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, 212013, China.; Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Jiangsu University, 301, Xuefu Road, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, 212013, China. xiasheng1519@163.com.",Humans; Thymus Gland; Proteostasis; Stromal Cells; Animals; Autoimmune Diseases; T-Lymphocytes,"81871234 (National Natural Science Foundation, China)",Journal Article; Review
38619272,"Virological, innate, and adaptive immune profiles shaped by variation in route and age of host in murine cytomegalovirus infection.","Human cytomegalovirus (hCMV) is a ubiquitous facultative pathogen, which establishes a characteristic latent and reactivating lifelong infection in immunocompetent hosts. Murine CMV (mCMV) infection is widely used as an experimental model of hCMV infection, employed to investigate the causal nature and extent of CMV's contribution to inflammatory, immunological, and health disturbances in humans. Therefore, mimicking natural human infection in mice would be advantageous to hCMV research. To assess the role of route and age at infection in modeling hCMV in mice, we infected prepubescent and young sexually mature C57BL/6 (B6) mice intranasally (i.n., a likely physiological route in humans) and intraperitoneally (i.p., a frequently used experimental route, possibly akin to transplant-mediated infection). In our hands, both routes led to comparable early viral loads and tissue spreads. However, they yielded differential profiles of innate and adaptive systemic immune activation. Specifically, the younger, prepubescent mice exhibited the strongest natural killer cell activation in the blood in response to i.p. infection. Further, the i.p. infected animals (particularly those infected at 12 weeks) exhibited larger anti-mCMV IgG and greater expansion of circulating CD8","Christopher P Coplen, Mladen Jergovic, Elana L Terner, Christine M Bradshaw, Jennifer L Uhrlaub, Janko Ž Nikolich",Journal of virology,2024,aging; cytomegalovirus; immunology; viral spread,10.1128/jvi.01986-23,"Department of Immunobiology, University of Arizona College of Medicine - Tucson, Tucson, Arizona, USA.; Department of Immunobiology, University of Arizona College of Medicine - Tucson, Tucson, Arizona, USA.; Department of Immunobiology, University of Arizona College of Medicine - Tucson, Tucson, Arizona, USA.; Department of Immunobiology, University of Arizona College of Medicine - Tucson, Tucson, Arizona, USA.; Department of Immunobiology, University of Arizona College of Medicine - Tucson, Tucson, Arizona, USA.; Department of Immunobiology, University of Arizona College of Medicine - Tucson, Tucson, Arizona, USA.","Animals; Female; Humans; Mice; Adaptive Immunity; Age Factors; Antibodies, Viral; Cytomegalovirus Infections; Disease Models, Animal; Herpesviridae Infections; Immunity, Innate; Killer Cells, Natural; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Muromegalovirus; Viral Load",R37 AG020719 (NIA NIH HHS); R37AG020719 (HHS | NIH | National Institute on Aging (NIA)),Journal Article

38613087,The Power of Psychobiotics in Depression: A Modern Approach through the Microbiota-Gut-Brain Axis: A Literature Review.,"The microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis is a complex communication network linking the gut, microbiota, and brain, influencing various aspects of health and disease. Dysbiosis, a disturbance in the gut microbiome equilibrium, can significantly impact the MGB axis, leading to alterations in microbial composition and function. Emerging evidence highlights the connection between microbiota alterations and neurological and psychiatric disorders, including depression. This review explores the potential of psychobiotics in managing depressive disorders, emphasizing their role in restoring microbial balance and influencing the MGB axis. Psychobiotics exhibit positive effects on the intestinal barrier, immune response, cortisol levels, and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Studies suggest that probiotics may serve as an adjunct therapy for depression, especially in treatment-resistant cases. This review discusses key findings from studies on psychobiotics interventions, emphasizing their impact on the gut-brain axis and mental health. The increasing acceptance of the expanded concept of the MGB axis underscores the importance of microorganisms in mental well-being. As our understanding of the microbiome's role in health and disease grows, probiotics emerge as promising agents for addressing mental health issues, providing new avenues for therapeutic interventions in depressive disorders.","Angela Dziedzic, Karina Maciak, Katarzyna Bliźniewska-Kowalska, Małgorzata Gałecka, Weronika Kobierecka, Joanna Saluk",Nutrients,2024,depression; gut–brain axis; microbiota–gut–brain axis; probiotics; psychobiotics,10.3390/nu16071054,"University of Lodz, Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, Department of General Biochemistry, Pomorska 141/143, 90-236 Lodz, Poland.; University of Lodz, Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, Department of General Biochemistry, Pomorska 141/143, 90-236 Lodz, Poland.; Department of Adult Psychiatry, Medical University of Lodz, Aleksandrowska 159, 91-229 Lodz, Poland.; Department of Psychotherapy, Medical University of Lodz, Aleksandrowska 159, 91-229 Lodz, Poland.; University of Lodz, Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, Department of General Biochemistry, Pomorska 141/143, 90-236 Lodz, Poland.; University of Lodz, Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, Department of General Biochemistry, Pomorska 141/143, 90-236 Lodz, Poland.",Humans; Brain-Gut Axis; Depression; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Brain; Dysbiosis,N/A,Journal Article; Review
38612726,Targeting Group 3 Medulloblastoma by the Anti-PRUNE-1 and Anti-LSD1/KDM1A Epigenetic Molecules.,"Medulloblastoma (MB) is a highly malignant childhood brain tumor. Group 3 MB (Gr3 MB) is considered to have the most metastatic potential, and tailored therapies for Gr3 MB are currently lacking. Gr3 MB is driven by PRUNE-1 amplification or overexpression. In this paper, we found that PRUNE-1 was transcriptionally regulated by lysine demethylase LSD1/KDM1A. This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic potential of inhibiting both PRUNE-1 and LSD1/KDM1A with the selective inhibitors AA7.1 and SP-2577, respectively. We found that the pharmacological inhibition had a substantial efficacy on targeting the metastatic axis driven by PRUNE-1 (PRUNE-1-OTX2-TGFβ-PTEN) in Gr3 MB. Using RNA seq transcriptomic feature data in Gr3 MB primary cells, we provide evidence that the combination of AA7.1 and SP-2577 positively affects neuronal commitment, confirmed by glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive differentiation and the inhibition of the cytotoxic components of the tumor microenvironment and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by the down-regulation of N-Cadherin protein expression. We also identified an impairing action on the mitochondrial metabolism and, consequently, oxidative phosphorylation, thus depriving tumors cells of an important source of energy. Furthermore, by overlapping the genomic mutational signatures through WES sequence analyses with RNA seq transcriptomic feature data, we propose in this paper that the combination of these two small molecules can be used in a second-line treatment in advanced therapeutics against Gr3 MB. Our study demonstrates that the usage of PRUNE-1 and LSD1/KDM1A inhibitors in combination represents a novel therapeutic approach for these highly aggressive metastatic MB tumors.","Francesca Bibbò, Fatemeh Asadzadeh, Angelo Boccia, Carmen Sorice, Orazio Bianco, Carmen Daniela Saccà, Barbara Majello, Vittoria Donofrio, Delfina Bifano, Lucia De Martino, Lucia Quaglietta, Adriana Cristofano, Eugenio Maria Covelli, Giuseppe Cinalli, Veronica Ferrucci, Pasqualino De Antonellis, Massimo Zollo",International journal of molecular sciences,2024,KDM1A; Prune-1; TGF-β; epigenetics; immune system; medulloblastoma; metastasis,10.3390/ijms25073917,"Department of Molecular Medicine and Medical Biotechnological DMMBM, University Federico II of Naples, 80131 Naples, Italy.; CEINGE Biotecnologie Avanzate ""Franco Salvatore"", 80131 Naples, Italy.; CEINGE Biotecnologie Avanzate ""Franco Salvatore"", 80131 Naples, Italy.; CEINGE Biotecnologie Avanzate ""Franco Salvatore"", 80131 Naples, Italy.; CEINGE Biotecnologie Avanzate ""Franco Salvatore"", 80131 Naples, Italy.; Department of Biology, University Federico II of Naples, 80138 Naples, Italy.; Department of Biology, University Federico II of Naples, 80138 Naples, Italy.; Department of Pathology, Santobono-Pausilipon Children's Hospital, AORN, 80129 Naples, Italy.; Department of Pathology, Santobono-Pausilipon Children's Hospital, AORN, 80129 Naples, Italy.; Pediatric Neuro-Oncology, Santobono-Pausilipon Children's Hospital, AORN, 80129 Naples, Italy.; Pediatric Neuro-Oncology, Santobono-Pausilipon Children's Hospital, AORN, 80129 Naples, Italy.; Pediatric Neuroradiology, Santobono-Pausilipon Children's Hospital, AORN, 80129 Naples, Italy.; Pediatric Neuroradiology, Santobono-Pausilipon Children's Hospital, AORN, 80129 Naples, Italy.; Pediatric Neurosurgery, Santobono-Pausilipon Children's Hospital, AORN, 80129 Naples, Italy.; Department of Molecular Medicine and Medical Biotechnological DMMBM, University Federico II of Naples, 80131 Naples, Italy.; Department of Molecular Medicine and Medical Biotechnological DMMBM, University Federico II of Naples, 80131 Naples, Italy.; Department of Molecular Medicine and Medical Biotechnological DMMBM, University Federico II of Naples, 80131 Naples, Italy.","Humans; Child; Medulloblastoma; Brain Neoplasms; Cerebellar Neoplasms; Histone Demethylases; Epigenesis, Genetic; Tumor Microenvironment","AIRC Grant IG no. 22129 (Italian Association for Cancer Research); (PRIN2017) No. 2017FNZRN3 (M.Z); (Ministero dell'Università e della Ricerca Italiana); No. 2022MXFLMZ (M.Z) (Ministero dell'Università e della Ricerca Italiana); No. 2022T59RWR (M.Z. and V.F) (European Union- Next Generation EU); MUR: CN00000006-CUP: E63C22002170007 (M.Z).

38599165,The NLR family of innate immune and cell death sensors.,"Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors, also known as nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat receptors (NLRs), are a family of cytosolic pattern recognition receptors that detect a wide variety of pathogenic and sterile triggers. Activation of specific NLRs initiates pro- or anti-inflammatory signaling cascades and the formation of inflammasomes-multi-protein complexes that induce caspase-1 activation to drive inflammatory cytokine maturation and lytic cell death, pyroptosis. Certain NLRs and inflammasomes act as integral components of larger cell death complexes-PANoptosomes-driving another form of lytic cell death, PANoptosis. Here, we review the current understanding of the evolution, structure, and function of NLRs in health and disease. We discuss the concept of NLR networks and their roles in driving cell death and immunity. An improved mechanistic understanding of NLRs may provide therapeutic strategies applicable across infectious and inflammatory diseases and in cancer.","Balamurugan Sundaram, Rebecca E Tweedell, Sivakumar Prasanth Kumar, Thirumala-Devi Kanneganti",Immunity,2024,DAMP; IL-18; IL-1β; NF-κB; NLR; NLR network; PAMP; PANoptosis; PANoptosome; RIPK; apoptosis; caspase-1; gasdermin; inflammasome; inflammatory cell death; innate immune cell death; interferon; necroptosis; pattern recognition receptor; pyroptosis,10.1016/j.immuni.2024.03.012,"Department of Immunology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.; Department of Immunology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.; Department of Immunology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.; Department of Immunology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.

MSC-derived exosomes are a promising off-the-shelf therapy for promoting wound healing in a cell-free manner. However, the potential to customize the content of MSC-exosomes, and understanding how such modifications influence exosome effects on tissue regeneration remain underexplored. In this study, we used an in vitro system to compare the priming of human MSCs by 2 inflammatory inducers TNF-α and CRX-527 (a highly potent synthetic TLR4 agonist that can be used as a vaccine adjuvant or to induce anti-tumor immunity) on exosome molecular cargo, as well as on an in vivo rat ligament injury model to validate exosome potency. Different microenvironmental stimuli used to prime MSCs in vitro affected their exosomal microRNAs and mRNAs, influencing ligament healing. Exosomes derived from untreated MSCs significantly enhance the mechanical properties of healing ligaments, in contrast to those obtained from MSCs primed with inflammation-inducers, which not only fail to provide any improvement but also potentially deteriorate the mechanical properties. Additionally, a link was identified between altered exosomal microRNA levels and expression changes in microRNA targets in ligaments. These findings elucidate the nuanced interplay between MSCs, their exosomes, and tissue regeneration.","Connie S Chamberlain, Archana Prabahar, John A Kink, Erika Mueller, Yiyao Li, Stephanie Yopp, Christian M Capitini, Peiman Hematti, William L Murphy, Ray Vanderby, Peng Jiang","Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",2024,TLR4 agonist (CRX-527); TNF-α; exosomes; ligament healing; mesenchymal stromal cells,10.1093/stmcls/sxae028,"Department of Orthopedics and Rehabilitation, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706, United States.; Center for Gene Regulation in Health and Disease, Cleveland State University, Cleveland, OH 44115, United States.; Department of Medicine, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706, United States.; Department of Orthopedics and Rehabilitation, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706, United States.; Department of Orthopedics and Rehabilitation, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706, United States.; Department of Orthopedics and Rehabilitation, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706, United States.; Carbone Cancer Center, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706, United States.; Department of Medicine, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706, United States.; Department of Orthopedics and Rehabilitation, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706, United States.; Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706, United States.; Center for Gene Regulation in Health and Disease, Cleveland State University, Cleveland, OH 44115, United States.","Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Exosomes; Humans; Animals; Rats; Wound Healing; Ligaments; Cellular Microenvironment; MicroRNAs; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Male","P30 CA014520 (NCI NIH HHS); R01 HL153721 (NHLBI NIH HHS); AWD00001593 (DARPA); NIH/NCI P30 CA014520, NIH/NHLBI R01 HL153721 (University of Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center)",Journal Article

We hypothesized that proteomic profiling targeting proteins involved in thrombus formation, inflammation, and the immune response would identify potentially new biomarkers for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Four existing panels of the Olink proximity extension assay covering 356 proteins involved in thrombus formation, inflammation, and immune response were applied to randomly selected patients with suspected HIT (confirmed HIT, n = 32; HIT ruled out, n = 38; and positive heparin/platelet factor 4 [H/PF4] antibodies, n = 28). The relative difference in protein concentration was analyzed using a linear regression model adjusted for sex and age. To confirm the test results, soluble P-selectin was determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in above mentioned patients and an additional second data set (n = 49). HIT was defined as a positive heparin-induced platelet activation assay (washed platelet assay). Among 98 patients of the primary data set, the median 4Ts score was 5 in patients with HIT, 4 in patients with positive H/PF4 antibodies, and 3 in patients without HIT. The median optical density of a polyspecific H/PF4 ELISA were 3.0, 0.9, and 0.3. Soluble P-selectin remained statistically significant after multiple test adjustments.

38581301,Polymer Backpack-Loaded Tissue Infiltrating Monocytes for Treating Cancer.,"Adoptive cell therapies are dramatically altering the treatment landscape of cancer. However, treatment of solid tumors remains a major unmet need, in part due to limited adoptive cell infiltration into the tumor and in part due to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. The heterogeneity of tumors and presence of nonresponders also call for development of antigen-independent therapeutic approaches. Myeloid cells offer such an opportunity, given their large presence in the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, such as in triple negative breast cancer. However, their therapeutic utility is hindered by their phenotypic plasticity. Here, the impressive trafficking ability of adoptively transferred monocytes is leveraged into the immunosuppressive 4T1 tumor to develop an antitumor therapy. To control monocyte differentiation in the tumor microenvironment, surface-adherent ""backpacks"" stably modified with interferon gamma (IFNγ) are developed to stimulate macrophage plasticity into a pro-inflammatory, antitumor phenotype, a strategy as referred to as Ornate Polymer backpacks on Tissue Infiltrating Monocytes (OPTIMs). Treatment with OPTIMs substantially reduces tumor burden in a mouse 4T1 model and significantly increases survival. Cytokine and immune cell profiling reveal that OPTIMs remodeled the tumor microenvironment into a pro-inflammatory state.","Neha Kapate, Michael Dunne, Alexander P Gottlieb, Malini Mukherji, Vineeth Chandran Suja, Supriya Prakash, Kyung Soo Park, Ninad Kumbhojkar, Jennifer L Guerriero, Samir Mitragotri",Advanced healthcare materials,2024,cancer; cell therapy; immunotherapy; microparticles; monocytes,10.1002/adhm.202304144,"Harvard John A.

38579776,RISING STARS: Androgens and immune cell function.,"Androgens can modulate immune cell function and may contribute to differences in the prevalence and severity of common inflammatory conditions. Although most immune cells are androgen targets, our understanding of how changes in androgen bioavailability can affect immune responses is incomplete. Androgens alter immune cell composition, phenotype, and activation by modulating the expression and secretion of inflammatory mediators or by altering the development and maturation of immune cell precursors. Androgens are generally associated with having suppressive effects on the immune system, but their impacts are cell and tissue context-dependent and can be highly nuanced even within immune cell subsets. In response to androgens, innate immune cells such as neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages increase the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and decrease nitric oxide production. Androgens promote the differentiation of T cell subsets and reduce the production of inflammatory mediators, such as IFNG, IL-4 and IL-5. Additionally, androgens/androgen receptor can promote the maturation of B cells. Thus, androgens can be considered as immunomodulatory agents, but further work is required to understand the precise molecular pathways that are regulated at the intersection between endocrine and inflammatory signals. This narrative review focusses on summarising our current understanding of how androgens can alter immune cell function and how this might affect inflammatory responses in health and disease.","Rebecca J Ainslie, Ioannis Simitsidellis, Phoebe M Kirkwood, Douglas A Gibson",The Journal of endocrinology,2024,androgen; androgen receptor; immune system; inflammatory diseases; testosterone,10.1530/JOE-23-0398,"Institute for Regeneration and Repair, the University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh BioQuarter, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.; Institute for Regeneration and Repair, the University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh BioQuarter, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.; Institute for Regeneration and Repair, the University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh BioQuarter, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.; Institute for Regeneration and Repair, the University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh BioQuarter, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.","Humans; Androgens; Animals; Inflammation; Immune System; Receptors, Androgen",N/A,"Journal Article; Review; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"
38579493,Hepatic interoception in health and disease.,"The liver is a large organ with crucial functions in metabolism and immune defense, as well as blood homeostasis and detoxification, and it is clearly in bidirectional communication with the brain and rest of the body via both neural and humoral pathways. A host of neural sensory mechanisms have been proposed, but in contrast to the gut-brain axis, details for both the exact site and molecular signaling steps of their peripheral transduction mechanisms are generally lacking. Similarly, knowledge about function-specific sensory and motor components of both vagal and spinal access pathways to the hepatic parenchyma is missing. Lack of progress largely owes to controversies regarding selectivity of vagal access pathways and extent of hepatocyte innervation. In contrast, there is considerable evidence for glucose sensors in the wall of the hepatic portal vein and their importance for glucose handling by the liver and the brain and the systemic response to hypoglycemia. As liver diseases are on the rise globally, and there are intriguing associations between liver diseases and mental illnesses, it will be important to further dissect and identify both neural and humoral pathways that mediate hepatocyte-specific signals to relevant brain areas. The question of whether and how sensations from the liver contribute to interoceptive self-awareness has not yet been explored.","Hans-Rudolf Berthoud, Heike Münzberg, Christopher D Morrison, Winfried L Neuhuber",Autonomic neuroscience : basic & clinical,2024,Brain; DRG neurons; Energy balance; Energy intake; Glucose sensing; Liver; Liver disease; Mental illness; Osmosensing; Spinal cord; Vagus nerve,10.1016/j.autneu.2024.103174,"Neurobiology of Nutrition & Metabolism Department, Pennington Biomedical Research Center, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA, USA.

However, hydrogels used to encase and protect non-autologous cells from immune rejection often suffer from poor mechanical properties, insufficient oxygenation, and fibrotic encapsulation. Here, we introduce a composite encapsulation system comprising an oxygen-permeable silicone cryogel skeleton, a hydrogel matrix, and a fibrosis-resistant polymer coating. Cryogel skeletons enhance the fracture toughness of conventional alginate hydrogels by 23-fold and oxygen diffusion by 2.8-fold, effectively mitigating both implant fracture and hypoxia of encapsulated cells. Composite implants containing xenogeneic cells engineered to secrete erythropoietin significantly outperform unsupported alginate implants in therapeutic delivery over 8 weeks in immunocompetent mice. By improving mechanical resiliency and sustaining denser cell populations, silicone cryogel skeletons enable more durable and miniaturized therapeutic implants.","William J Jeang, Matthew A Bochenek, Suman Bose, Yichao Zhao, Bryan M Wong, Jiawei Yang, Alexis L Jiang, Robert Langer, Daniel G Anderson",Science advances,2024,N/A,10.1126/sciadv.adk5949,"Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.; David H Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.; David H Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.; David H Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.; Department of Biological Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.; David H Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.; Department of Computer Science, Wellesley College, Wellesley, MA 02481, USA.; David H Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.; David H Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.",Mice; Animals; Hydrogels; Cryogels; Silicones; Alginates; Oxygen; Skeleton; Cell Survival,N/A,Journal Article
38578507,Quality of life after immune suppressive therapy in aplastic anemia.,"Acquired aplastic anemia (AA) is a rare form of immune-mediated bone marrow failure, which can result in life-threatening infections or bleeding if left untreated. Treatment consists of either immune suppressive therapy (IST) or allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT). While considerable research has been published regarding survival, response rate and toxicity of both treatments, knowledge on the impact on quality of life (QoL) is scarce. We used the recently developed AA-specific QoL questionnaire (QLQ-AA/PNH-54) to evaluate QoL in a single center cohort of AA patients who were successfully treated with IST. The 54 questions represent 12 different QoL domains. Results were analyzed for all patients and grouped based on hematologic response (complete response (CR) or partial response (PR)). Thirty-six successfully treated adult patients (15 in CR, 21 in PR) completed the questionnaire (median age 54 years, range 21-71; median time since last IST 5 years, range 0-41). Fatigue was experienced by 83% of patients. Even though total QoL scores did not significantly differ between patients with PR and CR (105 vs 92, p-value 0,17) there appeared to be a trend towards higher scores in patients with PR, especially in domains concerning psychological wellbeing. This trend was most clear in the domains fear of progression (2,12 in PR patients vs 1,73 in CR patients; p-value 0,08) and role functioning (2,22 vs 1,88; p-value 0,07). In conclusion, patients with AA continue to experience psychological and physical effects despite successful IST.","Iris N Lommerse, Chris Hinnen, Liesbeth M van Vliet, Beke Schubert, Jens Panse, Constantijn J M Halkes, Jennifer M-L Tjon",Annals of hematology,2024,Aplastic Anemia; Hematology; Immune Suppressive Treatment; Quality of life,10.1007/s00277-024-05731-x,"Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Centre, Leiden, The Netherlands. i.n.lommerse@lumc.nl.; Department of Psychology, Leiden University Medical Centre, Leiden, The Netherlands.; Health, Medical and Neuropsychology Unit, Institute of Psychology, Leiden University, Leiden, The Netherlands.; Department of Hematology, HagaZiekenhuis, The Hague, the Netherlands.; Department of Oncology, Hematology, Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Hospital RWTH Aachen, Aachen, Germany.; Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Centre, Leiden, The Netherlands.; Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Centre, Leiden, The Netherlands.","Humans; Anemia, Aplastic; Quality of Life; Adult; Male; Middle Aged; Female; Aged; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult; Immunosuppressive Agents; Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation",N/A,Journal Article

In recent years, SUMOylation has become increasingly important. SUMOylation is a post-translational modification in which small ubiquitin-related modifiers (SUMO) are covalently attached to target proteins. Sites where these SUMO modification processes take place in the cell nucleus are PML nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) - multiprotein complexes with their essential main component and organizer, the PML protein. PML and SUMO, either alone or as partners, influence a variety of cellular processes, including regulation of transcription, senescence, DNA damage response and defence against microorganisms, and are involved in innate immunity and inflammatory responses. They also play an important role in maintaining homeostasis in the vascular system and in pathological processes leading to the development and progression of cardiovascular diseases.

We performed a retrospective chart review of the results of an ongoing universal SARS-CoV-2 testing program for New Jersey correctional system HCWs and describe their presenting symptoms, perceived exposure, and demographic characteristics during the initial (March 15, 2020, to August 31, 2020) and Omicron (March 1, 2022, to August 31, 2022) COVID-19 surges. Analysis included 123 eligible records. In both surges, nurses had a high proportion of infections and cough was the most commonly reported symptom. Fever was more than twice as commonly reported in the initial surge. During the Omicron surge, nasal symptoms predominated (39.5% [95% CI: 28.4-51.4]) compared with the initial surge (8.5% [95% CI: 2.4-20.4]). Perceived exposure source was predominantly work related during the initial surge and multiple other sources of exposure were identified during the Omicron surge. Ninety-six percent of HCWs received a COVID-19 booster shot by February 2022. The reinfection rate was less than 10% for our initial cohort. Presenting symptoms correlated with the circulating variant. Mass vaccination of staff, the lower virulence of the Omicron variant, and possibly prior infection likely contributed to the milder illness experienced during the Omicron surge.","Maryam Yassa, Judith M Graber, Kathleen Black, Adriana Dos Santos Brandao De Resende, Alicia Legard, Julie Caruth",Journal of correctional health care : the official journal of the National Commission on Correctional Health Care,2024,COVID-19 in health care workers; COVID-19 symptoms; SARS-CoV-2; correctional; prison,10.1089/jchc.23.09.0072,"Department of Environmental and Occupational Medicine, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Piscataway, New Jersey, USA.; Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences Institute, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, Piscataway, New Jersey, USA.; Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences Institute, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, Piscataway, New Jersey, USA.; Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences Institute, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, Piscataway, New Jersey, USA.; Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences Institute, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, Piscataway, New Jersey, USA.; Environmental and Occupational Health and Justice, School of Public Health, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, Piscataway, New Jersey, USA.",Humans; COVID-19; Male; Female; Retrospective Studies; Health Personnel; Adult; SARS-CoV-2; Middle Aged; New Jersey; Prisons; COVID-19 Vaccines; Correctional Facilities,N/A,Journal Article
38572110,Macrophage senescence in health and diseases.,"Macrophage senescence, manifested by the special form of durable cell cycle arrest and chronic low-grade inflammation like senescence-associated secretory phenotype, has long been considered harmful. Persistent senescence of macrophages may lead to maladaptation, immune dysfunction, and finally the development of age-related diseases, infections, autoimmune diseases, and malignancies. However, it is a ubiquitous, multi-factorial, and dynamic complex phenomenon that also plays roles in remodeled processes, including wound repair and embryogenesis. In this review, we summarize some general molecular changes and several specific biomarkers during macrophage senescence, which may bring new sight to recognize senescent macrophages in different conditions. Also, we take an in-depth look at the functional changes in senescent macrophages, including metabolism, autophagy, polarization, phagocytosis, antigen presentation, and infiltration or recruitment. Furthermore, some degenerations and diseases associated with senescent macrophages as well as the mechanisms or relevant genetic regulations of senescent macrophages are integrated, not only emphasizing the possibility of regulating macrophage senescence to benefit age-associated diseases but also has an implication on the finding of potential targets or drugs clinically.","Longling Wang, Wenxiang Hong, Hong Zhu, Qiaojun He, Bo Yang, Jiajia Wang, Qinjie Weng",Acta pharmaceutica Sinica.

38567062,Modulation of macrophages by biophysical cues in health and beyond.,"Macrophages play a key role in tissue development and homeostasis, innate immune defence against microbes or tumours, and restoring homeostasis through tissue regeneration following infection or injury. The ability to adopt such diverse functions is due to their heterogeneous nature, which is driven largely by their developmental origin and their response to signals they encounter from the microenvironment. The most well-characterized signals driving macrophage phenotype and function are biochemical and metabolic. However, the way macrophages sense and respond to their extracellular biophysical environment is becoming increasingly recognized in the field of mechano-immunology. These biophysical cues can be signals from tissue components, such as the composition and charge of extracellular matrix or topography, elasticity, and stiffness of the tissue surrounding cells; and mechanical forces such as shear stress or stretch. Macrophages are important in determining whether a disease resolves or becomes chronic. Ageing and diseases such as cancer or fibrotic disorders are associated with significant changes in the tissue biophysical environment, and this provides signals that integrate with those from biochemical and metabolic stimuli to ultimately dictate the overall function of macrophages. This review provides a brief overview of macrophage polarization, followed by a selection of commonly recognized physiological and applied biophysical stimuli impacting macrophage activity, and the potential signalling mechanisms driving downstream responses. The effects of biophysical cues on macrophages' function in homeostasis and disease and the associated clinical implications are also highlighted.",Heather M Wilson,Discovery immunology,2023,biophysical cues; extracellular matrix; macrophages; mechanosensing; mechanotransduction,10.1093/discim/kyad013,"School of Medicine, Medical Sciences and Nutrition, Institute of Medical Sciences, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, UK.",N/A,N/A,Journal Article; Review
38566585,Long-term dynamics of natural killer cells in response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination: Persistently enhanced activity postvaccination.,"Natural Killer (NK) cells play a significant role in the early defense against virus infections and cancer. Recent studies have demonstrated the involvement of NK cells in both the induction and effector phases of vaccine-induced immunity in various contexts. However, their role in shaping immune responses following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination remains poorly understood. To address this matter, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of NK cell phenotype and function in SARS-CoV-2 unexposed individuals who received the BNT162b2 vaccine. We employed a longitudinal study design and utilized a panel of 53 15-mer overlapping peptides covering the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein to assess NK cell function at 0 and 20 days following the first vaccine, and 30 and 240 days following booster. Additionally, we evaluated the levels of total IgG anti-Spike antibodies and their potential neutralizing ability. Our findings revealed an increased NK cell activity upon re-exposure to RBD when combined with IL12 and IL18 several months after booster. Concurrently, we observed that the frequencies of NKG2A + NK cells declined over the course of the follow-up period, while NKG2C increased only in CMV positive subjects. The finding that NK cell functions are inducible 9 months after vaccination upon re-exposure to RBD and cytokines, sheds light on the role of NK cells in contributing to SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-induced immune protection and pave the way to further studies in the field.","Dalila Mele, Sabrina Ottolini, Andrea Lombardi, Daniela Conteianni, Alessandra Bandera, Barbara Oliviero, Stefania Mantovani, Irene Cassaniti, Fausto Baldanti, Andrea Gori, Mario U Mondelli, Stefania Varchetta",Journal of medical virology,2024,CD107a; NKG2A; NKG2C; SARS‐CoV‐2; natural killer cells; vaccine,10.1002/jmv.29585,"Division of Clinical Immunology - Infectious Diseases, Department of Research, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy.; Department of Internal Medicine and Therapeutics, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy.; Department of Pathophysiology and Transplantation, University of Milano, Milano, Italy.; Division of Clinical Immunology - Infectious Diseases, Department of Research, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy.; Department of Pathophysiology and Transplantation, University of Milano, Milano, Italy.; Division of Clinical Immunology - Infectious Diseases, Department of Research, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy.; Division of Clinical Immunology - Infectious Diseases, Department of Research, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy.; Department of Microbiology and Virology, Molecular Virology Unit, Fondazione IRCCS, Policlinico S.

38564126,An evaluation of a hepatotoxicity risk induced by the microplastic polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) using HepG2/THP-1 co-culture model.,"Inappropriate disposal of plastic wastes and their durability in nature cause uncontrolled accumulation of plastic in land/marine ecosystems, also causing destructive effects by bioaccumulating along the food chain. Microplastics may cause chronic inflammation in relation to their permanent structures, especially through oxidative stress and cytotoxic cellular damage, which could increase the risk of cancer development. The accumulation of microplastics in the liver is a major concern, and therefore, the identification of the mechanisms of their hepatotoxic effects is of great importance. Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) is a widely used thermoplastic. It has been determined that PMMA disrupts lipid metabolism in the liver in various aquatic organisms and causes reproductive and developmental toxicity. PMMA-induced hepatotoxic effects in humans have not yet been clarified. In our study, the toxic effects of PMMA (in the range of 3-10 μm) on the human liver were investigated using the HepG2/THP-1 macrophage co-culture model, which is a sensitive immune-mediated liver injury model. Cellular uptake of micro-sized PMMA in the cells was done by transmission electron microscopy. Determination of its effects on cell viability and inflammatory response, oxidative stress, along with gene and protein expression levels that play a role in the mechanism pathways underlying the effects were investigated. The results concluded that inflammation, oxidative stress, and disruptions in lipid metabolism should be the focus of attention as important underlying causes of PMMA-induced hepatotoxicity.

38562902,Primary nasal viral infection rewires the tissue-scale memory response.,"The nasal mucosa is frequently the initial site of respiratory viral infection, replication, and transmission. Recent work has started to clarify the independent responses of epithelial, myeloid, and lymphoid cells to viral infection in the nasal mucosa, but their spatiotemporal coordination and relative contributions remain unclear. Furthermore, understanding whether and how primary infection shapes tissue-scale memory responses to secondary challenge is critical for the rational design of nasal-targeting therapeutics and vaccines. Here, we generated a single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) atlas of the murine nasal mucosa sampling three distinct regions before and during primary and secondary influenza infection. Primary infection was largely restricted to respiratory mucosa and induced stepwise changes in cell type, subset, and state composition over time.

Key features of these communities-composition, diversity, and burden-are consistently altered in lung disease, associate with host physiology and immunity, and can predict clinical outcomes. Although initial studies of the lung microbiome were descriptive, recent studies have leveraged advances in technology to identify metabolically active microbes and potential associations with their immunomodulatory by-products and lung disease. In this brief review, we discuss novel insights in airway disease and parenchymal lung disease, exploring host-microbiome interactions in disease pathogenesis. We also discuss complex interactions between gut and oropharyngeal microbiota and lung immunobiology. Our advancing knowledge of the lung microbiome will provide disease targets in acute and chronic lung disease and may facilitate the development of new therapeutic strategies.","Jay H Lipinksi, Piyush Ranjan, Robert P Dickson, David N O'Dwyer","Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2024,N/A,10.4049/jimmunol.2300716,"Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI.; Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI.; Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI.; Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI.",Humans; Lung; Lung Diseases; Microbiota,R01 HL162659 (NHLBI NIH HHS),Review; Journal Article

Their presence in neurodegenerative diseases is known, with neurodegeneration-associated risk genes heavily expressed in microglia, highlighting their importance in contributing to disease pathogenesis. Transcriptomics studies have uncovered the heterogeneous landscape of microglia in health and disease, identifying important disease-associated signatures such as DAM, and insight into both the regional and temporal diversity of microglia phenotypes. Quantitative mass spectrometry methods are ever increasing in the field of neurodegeneration, utilised as ways to identify disease biomarkers and to gain deeper understanding of disease pathology. Proteins are the main mechanistic indicators of cellular function, yet discordance between transcript and proteomic findings has highlighted the need for in-depth proteomic phenotypic and functional analysis to fully understand disease kinetics at the cellular and molecular level.

38557358,Positioning implementation science in national immunization programmes to improve coverage equity and advance progress toward Immunization Agenda 2030: An urgent global health imperative.,"Despite the availability of effective vaccines for preventing common childhood infectious diseases, there is still significant disparities in access and utilization across many low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). The factors that drive these disparities are often multilevel, originating from individuals, health facilities, health systems and communities, and also multifaceted. Implementation science has emerged as a field to help address ""know-do"" gaps in health systems, and can play a significant role in strengthening immunization systems to understand and solve implementation barriers that limit access and uptake within their contexts. This article presents a reflexive perspective on how to position implementation research in immunization programmes to improve coverage equity. Furthermore, key points of synergy between implementation research and vaccination are highlighted, and some potential practice changes that can be applied within specific contexts were proposed. Using a human rights lens, it was concluded that the cost that is associated with implementation failure in immunization programmes is significant and unjust, and future directions for implementation research to optimize its application in practice settings have been recommended.","Abdu A Adamu, Duduzile Ndwandwe, Rabiu I Jalo, Charles S Wiysonge",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,2024,Implementation science; complexity; global health; immunization; systems thinking,10.1080/21645515.2024.2331872,"Cochrane South Africa, South African Medical Research Council, Cape Town, South Africa.; Cochrane South Africa, South African Medical Research Council, Cape Town, South Africa.; Department of Community Medicine, Bayero University/Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital, Kano, Nigeria.; Cochrane South Africa, South African Medical Research Council, Cape Town, South Africa.",Humans; Child; Global Health; Implementation Science; Vaccination; Immunization; Vaccines; Immunization Programs,001 (World Health Organization),Journal Article

38552653,Microglia at the blood brain barrier in health and disease.,"The blood brain barrier (BBB) plays a crucial role in maintaining brain homeostasis by selectively preventing the entry of substances from the peripheral blood into the central nervous system (CNS). Comprised of endothelial cells, pericytes, and astrocytes, this highly regulated barrier encompasses the majority of the brain's vasculature. In addition to its protective function, the BBB also engages in significant crosstalk with perivascular macrophages (MΦ) and microglia, the resident MΦ of the brain. These interactions play a pivotal role in modulating the activation state of cells comprising the BBB, as well as MΦs and microglia, themselves. Alterations in systemic metabolic and inflammatory states can promote endothelial cell dysfunction, reducing the integrity of the BBB and potentially allowing peripheral blood factors to leak into the CNS compartment. This may mediate activation of perivascular MΦs, microglia, and astrocytes, and initiate further immune responses within the brain parenchyma, suggesting neuroinflammation can be triggered by signaling from the periphery, without primary injury or disease originating within the CNS. The intricate interplay between the periphery and the CNS through the BBB highlights the importance of understanding the role of microglia in mediating responses to systemic challenges. Despite recent advancements, our understanding of the interactions between microglia and the BBB is still in its early stages, leaving a significant gap in knowledge. However, emerging research is shedding light on the involvement of microglia at the BBB in various conditions, including systemic infections, diabetes, and ischemic stroke. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current research investigating the intricate relationship between microglia and the BBB in health and disease. By exploring these connections, we hope to advance our understanding of the role of brain immune responses to systemic challenges and their impact on CNS health and pathology. Uncovering these interactions may hold promise for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for neurological conditions that involve immune and vascular mechanisms.","Meredith G Mayer, Tracy Fischer",Frontiers in cellular neuroscience,2024,BBB; blood-brain barrier; endothelial cells; microglia; neuroinflammation; stroke; systemic inflammation,10.3389/fncel.2024.1360195,"Division of Comparative Pathology, Tulane National Primate Research Center, Covington, LA, United States.; Division of Comparative Pathology, Tulane National Primate Research Center, Covington, LA, United States.",N/A,N/A,Journal Article; Review
38550920,Cross-population applications of genomics to understand the risk of multifactorial traits involving inflammation and immunity.,"The interplay between genetic and environmental factors plays a significant role in interindividual variation in immune and inflammatory responses. The availability of high-throughput low-cost genotyping and next-generation sequencing has revolutionized our ability to identify human genetic variation and understand how this varies within and between populations, and the relationship with disease. In this review, we explore the potential of genomics for patient benefit, specifically in the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of inflammatory and immune-related diseases. We summarize the knowledge arising from genetic and functional genomic approaches, and the opportunity for personalized medicine. The review covers applications in infectious diseases, rare immunodeficiencies and autoimmune diseases, illustrating advances in diagnosis and understanding risk including use of polygenic risk scores. We further explore the application for patient stratification and drug target prioritization. The review highlights a key challenge to the field arising from the lack of sufficient representation of genetically diverse populations in genomic studies. This currently limits the clinical utility of genetic-based diagnostic and risk-based applications in non-Caucasian populations. We highlight current genome projects, initiatives and biobanks from diverse populations and how this is being used to improve healthcare globally by improving our understanding of genetic susceptibility to diseases and regional pathogens such as malaria and tuberculosis. Future directions and opportunities for personalized medicine and wider application of genomics in health care are described, for the benefit of individual patients and populations worldwide.","Bana Alamad, Kate Elliott, Julian C Knight",Cambridge prisms.

DNA methylation is thought to mediate the effects of social status on gene expression and phenotypic outcomes, yet a study of social status-specific DNA methylation profiles in different age classes in a wild social mammal is missing. We tested for social status signatures in DNA methylation profiles in wild female spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta), cubs and adults, using non-invasively collected gut epithelium samples. In spotted hyena clans, female social status influences access to resources, foraging behavior, health, reproductive performance and survival. We identified 149 differentially methylated regions between 42 high- and low-ranking female spotted hyenas (cubs and adults). Differentially methylated genes were associated with energy conversion, immune function, glutamate receptor signalling and ion transport.

After corticosteroids with or without intravenous immune globulin (first-line treatment), second-line treatment options include rituximab, splenectomy, thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RAs), and fostamatinib. In Canada, the choice of second-line therapy is influenced by access to medications. The goals of this narrative review are to 1) summarize the evidence for the use of TPO-RAs and other second-line therapies in ITP and 2) highlight differences in public funding criteria for TPO-RAs across provinces and territories in Canada.","Joanne Britto, Anne Holbrook, Haowei Sun, Christine Cserti-Gazdewich, Oksana Prokopchuk-Gauk, Cyrus Hsia, Karima Khamisa, Paul R Yenson, Michelle Sholzberg, Harold J Olney, Sudeep Shivakumar, David Jones, Hayley Merkeley, Jacqueline Costello, Erin Jamula, Donald M Arnold",Clinical and investigative medicine.

Despite this, knowledge on their basal levels in fluids, cells and tissues and any changes associated with age, gender and diet in health and disease; as well as their spatio-temporal distribution in cell membranes and organelles have been greatly hampered by the lack of commercially available pure synthetic standards. Expansion of the panel of pure oxysterol sulfates standards is pivotal to improve our understanding on the impact of oxysterol sulfates at the membrane level and their role in cellular events. While the clinical significance, biophysical implications and biological relevance of oxysterol sulfates in fluids, cells and tissues remains largely unknown, knowledge already gathered on the precursors of oxysterol sulfates (e.g. oxysterols and cholesterol sulfate) can be used to guide researchers on the most relevant aspects to search for when screening for oxysterol sulfates bioavailability in (patho)physiological conditions which are crucial in the design of biophysical and of cell-based assays.

38545093,Poliovirus-Neutralizing Antibody Seroprevalence and Vaccine Habits in a Vaccine-Derived Poliovirus Outbreak Region in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2018: The Impact on the Global Eradication Initiative.,"Despite the successes in wild-type polio eradication, poor vaccine coverage in the DRC has led to the occurrence of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus outbreaks. This cross-sectional population-based survey provides an update to previous poliovirus-neutralizing antibody seroprevalence studies in the DRC and quantifies risk factors for under-immunization and parental knowledge that guide vaccine decision making. Among the 964 children between 6 and 35 months in our survey, 43.8% (95% CI: 40.6-47.0%), 41.1% (38.0-44.2%), and 38.0% (34.9-41.0%) had protective neutralizing titers to polio types 1, 2, and 3, respectively. We found that 60.7% of parents reported knowing about polio, yet 25.6% reported knowing how it spreads. Our data supported the conclusion that polio outreach efforts were successfully connecting with communities-79.4% of participants had someone come to their home with information about polio, and 88.5% had heard of a polio vaccination campaign. Additionally, the odds of seroreactivity to only serotype 2 were far greater in health zones that had a history of supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) compared to health zones that did not. While SIAs may be reaching under-vaccinated communities as a whole, these results are a continuation of the downward trend of seroprevalence rates in this region.","Megan Halbrook, Adva Gadoth, Patrick Mukadi, Nicole A Hoff, Kamy Musene, Camille Dzogang, Cyrus Shannon Sinai, D'Andre Spencer, Guillaume Ngoie-Mwamba, Sylvia Tangney, Frank Salet, Michel Nyembwe, Michel Kambamba Nzaji, Merly Tambu, Placide Mbala, Trevon Fuller, Sue K Gerber, Didine Kaba, Jean Jacques Muyembe-Tamfum, Anne W Rimoin",Vaccines,2024,Democratic Republic of the Congo; IPV; OPV; SIAs; cVDPV; nOPV2; poliovirus; serosurvey; vaccine coverage,10.3390/vaccines12030246,"Department of Epidemiology, Jonathan and Karin Fielding School of Public Health, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.; Department of Epidemiology, Jonathan and Karin Fielding School of Public Health, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.; National Institute of Biomedical Research, Kinshasa P.O.

38543880,Alzheimer's Disease: A Molecular Model and Implied Path to Improved Therapy.,"Amyloid-associated neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), are characterized by the in-brain accumulation of β-sheet structured protein aggregates called amyloids. However, neither a disease model nor therapy is established. We review past data and present new, preliminary data and opinions to help solve this problem. The following is the data-derived model/hypothesis. (1) Amyloid-forming proteins have innate immunity functions implemented by conversion to another sheet conformation, α-sheet. (2) In health, α-sheet structured, amyloid-forming proteins inactivate microbes by co-assembly with microbe α-sheets. Amyloid-forming proteins then undergo α-to-β-sheet conversion. (3) In disease, α-sheet-structured, amyloid-forming proteins over-accumulate and are neuron-toxic. This hypothesis includes formation by virus capsid subunits of α-sheets. In support, we find that 5-10 mM methylene blue (MB) at 54 °C has a hyper-expanding, thinning effect on the phage T4 capsid, as seen by negative stain- and cryo-electron microscopy after initial detection by native gel electrophoresis (AGE). Given the reported mild anti-AD effect of MB, we propose the following corollary hypothesis. (1) Anti-AD MB activity is, at least in part, caused by MB-binding to amyloid α-sheet and (2) MB induces the transition to α-sheet of T4 capsid subunits. We propose using AGE of drug incubated T4 to test for improved anti-AD activity.","Meagan Susanne Weaver-Rosen, Philip Serwer",International journal of molecular sciences,2024,agarose gel electrophoresis; alpha-sheet; amyloid-forming proteins; disease modeling; drug effectiveness assay; molecular model; native,10.3390/ijms25063479,"Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Molecular Genetics, UT Health, San Antonio, TX 78229, USA.; Department of Biochemistry and Structural Biology, UT Health, San Antonio, TX 78229, USA.","Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Cryoelectron Microscopy; Amyloid; Amyloidogenic Proteins; Models, Molecular; Amyloid beta-Peptides",2022-2023 (Morrison Trust); 2022 (San Antonio Medical Foundation),Review; Journal Article
38542452,Influential Social Determinants of Adherence to Preventive and Health Promotion Activities during Pregnancy and the First Year of Life: Systematic Review.,"Effective monitoring throughout pregnancy and the first year of life is a crucial factor in achieving lower rates of maternal and infant mortality. Currently, research on socioeconomic factors that influence the lack of adherence to preventive and control measures during pregnancy and the first year of life is limited. The objective of this review is to examine the available evidence on social determinants that influence participation in health promotion and preventive activities throughout the pregnancy journey and in infants during their first year of life. We performed a systematic review of the literature searching in the major scientific databases (PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, WOS, and Cochrane Library) for articles from February 2017 to May 2023 containing information on health inequities that impact participation in health promotion and preventive measures from pregnancy through the first year of an infant's life. A total of 12 studies were selected; these studies were performed in ten different countries on five different continents. The selected studies cover preventive measures during maternal care, vaccination, and immunization during pregnancy and the first year of life, newborn screening, and follow-up of the first 12 months of life. The social factors associated with low adherence to health promotion activities during pregnancy and the first year of life include education, income, ethnicity, place of residence, and family characteristics. Despite the diverse geographical distribution, it is observed that there are common social factors linked to a decrease in the adherence to preventive measures during pregnancy and in the early years of life.","Julia Romero-Barranca, Emilio Garcia-Cabrera, Encarnación Román, Angélica Quintero-Flórez, Luis Gabriel Luque-Romero, Ángel Vilches-Arenas","Children (Basel, Switzerland)",2024,adherence to preventive measures; health inequities; health promotion; maternity; newborn health; social determinants of health; woman health,10.3390/children11030331,"Preventive Medicine and Public Health Department, Faculty of Medicine, University of Seville, Av.

38539366,Identification of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell and its receptor.,"The T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoires exhibits distinct signatures associated with COVID-19 severity. However, the precise identification of vaccine-induced SARS-CoV-2-specific TCRs and T-cell immunity mechanisms are unknown. We developed a machine-learning model that can differentiate COVID-19 patients from healthy individuals based on TCR sequence features with an accuracy of 95.7%. Additionally, we identified SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells and TCR in HLA-A*02 vaccinated individuals by peptide stimulation. The SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells exhibited higher cytotoxicity and prolonged survival when targeting spike-pulsed cells in vitro or in vivo. The top-performing TCR was further tested for its affinity and cytotoxic effect against SARS-CoV-2-associated epitopes. Furthermore, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), immune repertoire sequencing (IR-seq) and flow cytometry were used to access vaccine-induced cellular immunity, which demonstrated that robust T cell responses (T cell activation, tissue-resident memory T cell (Trm) generation, and TCR clonal expansion) could be induced by intranasal vaccination. In summary, we identified the SARS-CoV-2-associated TCR repertoires profile, specific TCRs and T cell responses. This study provides a theoretical basis for developing effective immunization strategies.","Qian Zhang, Qing Liang, Rui Zhang, Nan Wang, Xu Xiao, Jiahao Shao, Kejia Wang",Journal of hematology & oncology,2024,Immune repertoire; SARS-CoV-2; T cell immunity; T cell receptor,10.1186/s13045-024-01537-6,"Clinical Research Institute, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University, State Key Laboratory of Vaccines for Infectious Diseases, Xiang An Biomedicine Laboratory, School of Medicine, Xiamen University, Xiamen, 361102, Fujian, China.; Clinical Research Institute, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University, State Key Laboratory of Vaccines for Infectious Diseases, Xiang An Biomedicine Laboratory, School of Medicine, Xiamen University, Xiamen, 361102, Fujian, China.; Department of Emergency Medicine, Xiang'an Hospital of Xiamen University, School of Medicine, Xiamen University, Xiamen, 361102, Fujian, China.; Clinical Research Institute, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University, State Key Laboratory of Vaccines for Infectious Diseases, Xiang An Biomedicine Laboratory, School of Medicine, Xiamen University, Xiamen, 361102, Fujian, China.; National Institute for Data Science in Health and Medicine, Xiamen University, Xiamen, 361102, Fujian, China.; Shanghai Engineering Research Center of Intelligent Education and Bigdata, Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai, 200234, China.; Clinical Research Institute, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University, State Key Laboratory of Vaccines for Infectious Diseases, Xiang An Biomedicine Laboratory, School of Medicine, Xiamen University, Xiamen, 361102, Fujian, China. wangkejia@xmu.edu.cn.","Humans; T-Lymphocytes; SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19; Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell; Vaccines",92374105 (National Natural Science Foundation of China); 32322029 (National Natural Science Foundation of China); 2022J01011 (Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province); 2021J01017 (Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province); 20720230069 (Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); 2023XAKJ0101034 (Funds from Xiang An Biomedicine Laboratory),"Letter; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

Thymic B cells can play some role in regulating the most frequent allergic background worldwide, the atopy induced by the mite Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Der p). Here, we aimed to evaluate if the polyclonal IgG repertoire produced by Der p-atopic individuals can influence the homing and cytokine profile of human thymic B derived from non-atopic children aged less than seven days. With this purpose, we produced polyclonal IgG formulations and cultivated human thymocytes in their presence. We also assessed IgG subclasses and the direct interaction of IgG with thymic B cell membranes. Our results could demonstrate that Der p-atopic IgG could not reduce the expression of α4β7 homing molecule as observed in response to the other IgG formulations and could reduce the frequency of IFN-γ- and IL-9-producing thymic B cells compared to the mock condition. Der p-atopic IgG could also induce thymic IL-10-producing B cells compared to control conditions. The IgG derived from Der p-atopic individuals failed to diminish the population of IL-13-producing thymic B cells, unlike the reduction observed with other IgG formulations when compared to the mock condition. All IgG formulations had similar levels of IgG subclasses and directly interacted with thymic B cell membranes. Finally, we performed experiments using peripheral non-atopic B cells where IgG effects were not observed. In conclusion, our observation demonstrates that IgG induced in allergic individuals can modulate non-atopic thymic B cells, potentially generating thymic B cells prone to allergy development, which seems to not occur in mature B cells.","Daniela Terra de-Apoena Reche, Nicolle Rakanidis Machado, Beatriz Oliveira Fagundes, Isabella Siuffi Bergamasco, Thamires Rodrigues de Sousa, Lais Alves do Nascimento, Fernando Roberto Machado Cunha, Marilia Garcia de-Oliveira, Fábio da-Ressureição Sgnotto, Carolina Nunes França, Jefferson Russo Victor",Scientific reports,2024,Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus; Alfa-4; B cell; Beta-7; IFN-γ; IL-22; IL-9; IgG,10.1038/s41598-024-57950-x,"Post Graduation Program in Health Sciences, Santo Amaro University (UNISA), São Paulo, SP, 04829-300, Brazil.; Laboratory of Medical Investigation LIM-56, Division of Clinical Dermatology, Medical School, University of Sao Paulo, Av.

38534890,Adverse jaw outcomes from immune checkpoint inhibitors for head and neck cancer? Case reports.,"Radiation treatment plays a mainstream role in the management of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs). Adverse effects from radiation therapy include osteoradionecrosis of the jaw, and rarely, pathologic fracture. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) such as pembrolizumab are of growing relevance to the management of metastatic and recurrent HNSCCs. Adverse impacts on bone secondary to medications such as pembrolizumab and nivolumab have been sporadically documented in the literature. The objective of this manuscript is to raise awareness of possible increase in risk for adverse jaw outcomes in patients with HNSCCs exposed to both radiation treatment to the jaws and ICI therapy. This manuscript documents adverse jaw outcomes including osteonecrosis and pathologic fracture of the mandible in two patients receiving pembrolizumab for management of HNSCC who had received prior radiation treatment. A potential link between immunotherapy and adverse jaw outcomes is consistent with the growing understanding of osteoimmunology, investigating the closely interrelated processes in bone remodeling and immune system function, in health and disease. It is important to ascertain if pembrolizumab poses an incremental risk for such outcomes, beyond the risk from prior radiation, for patients managed with radiation treatment and ICI therapy for HNSCC. The general dental practitioner may encounter such patients either in the context of facilitating dental clearance prior to initiation of chemotherapy, or rarely, with poorly explained jaw symptoms and must be alert to the possibility of occurrence of such adverse jaw events to facilitate timely diagnosis and optimal patient management.","Gayathri Subramanian, Vincent Yeung, Soly Baredes, Sung Kim, Tessa Bergsbaken, Samuel Quek","Quintessence international (Berlin, Germany : 1985)",2024,adverse jaw outcomes; head and neck cancer; immune checkpoint inhibitors; immunotherapy; osteonecrosis; pembrolizumab; radiation therapy,10.3290/j.qi.b5128663,N/A,"Humans; Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck; Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors; Dentists; Fractures, Spontaneous; Professional Role; Head and Neck Neoplasms; Jaw",N/A,Case Reports; Journal Article
38534035,COVID-19 vaccination perspectives among patients with Long COVID: A qualitative study.,"Individuals who have Long COVID may have unique perspectives about COVID-19 vaccination due to the significant impact that COVID-19 has had on their lives. However, little is known about the specific vaccination perspectives among this patient population. The goal of our study was to improve our understanding of perspectives about COVID-19 vaccines among individuals with Long COVID. Interviews were conducted with patients receiving care at a post-COVID recovery clinic. Deductive thematic analysis was used to characterize participant perspectives according to the vaccine acceptance continuum framework, which recognizes a spectrum from vaccine acceptance to refusal. From interviews with 21 patients, we identified perspectives across the continuum of vaccine acceptance. These perspectives included acceptance of vaccines to prevent future illness, concerns about vaccine side effects on Long COVID symptoms, and refusal of vaccines due to perceived natural immunity. A limitation of our study is that these perspectives are specific to individuals receiving care at one post-COVID recovery clinic. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that some patients with Long COVID are uncertain about COVID-19 vaccines and boosters but may also be amenable to conversations that impact future vaccination acceptance. Patient perspectives should be considered when communicating recommendations for COVID-19 vaccinations to this population.","Sarah R MacEwan, Saurabh Rahurkar, Willi L Tarver, Alice A Gaughan, Laura J Rush, Andrew Schamess, Ann Scheck McAlearney",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,2024,Long COVID; Post-acute COVID-19 syndrome; booster; qualitative research; vaccination,10.1080/21645515.2024.2327663,"Division of General Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.; Center for the Advancement of Team Science, Analytics, and Systems Thinking in Health Services and Implementation Science Research (CATALYST), The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.; Center for the Advancement of Team Science, Analytics, and Systems Thinking in Health Services and Implementation Science Research (CATALYST), The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.; Center for the Advancement of Team Science, Analytics, and Systems Thinking in Health Services and Implementation Science Research (CATALYST), The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.; Center for the Advancement of Team Science, Analytics, and Systems Thinking in Health Services and Implementation Science Research (CATALYST), The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.; Division of General Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.; Center for the Advancement of Team Science, Analytics, and Systems Thinking in Health Services and Implementation Science Research (CATALYST), The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.","Humans; COVID-19 Vaccines; Post-Acute COVID-19 Syndrome; COVID-19; Vaccination; Immunization, Secondary",U54 CA260582 (NCI NIH HHS),"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural"

At present, surgery and medication are still the main treatments for cancer, without paying attention to the impact of individual differences in health management on cancer. However, increasing evidence suggests that individual psychological status, dietary habits, and exercise frequency are closely related to the risk and prognosis of cancer. The reminder to humanity is that the medical concept of the unified treatment plan is insufficient in cancer treatment, and a personalized treatment plan may become a breakthrough point. On this basis, the concept of ""Humanistic Health Management"" (HHM) is proposed. This concept is a healthcare plan that focuses on self-health management, providing an accurate and comprehensive evaluation of individual lifestyle habits, psychology, and health status, and developing personalized and targeted comprehensive cancer prevention and treatment plans. This review will provide a detailed explanation of the relationship between psychological status, dietary, and exercise habits, and the regulatory mechanisms of cancer. Intended to emphasize the importance of HHM concept in cancer prevention and better prognostic efficacy, providing new ideas for the new generation of cancer treatment.","Chenchen Li, Junfeng Zhang, Pengcheng Pan, Junjie Zhang, Xinyi Hou, Yan Wang, Guoping Chen, Pir Muhammad, Rui L Reis, Lin Ding, Yanli Wang","Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)",2024,cancer; exercise; humanistic health management; nutrition; psychology,10.1002/advs.202400665,"International Joint Research Center of Human-machine Intelligent Collaborative for Tumor Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Hainan Province & Key Laboratory of Tropical Translational Medicine of Ministry of Education, School of Pharmacy & The First Affiliated Hospital, Hainan Medical University, Haikou, 571199, P.

38524919,A guide to germ-free and gnotobiotic mouse technology to study health and disease.,"The intestinal microbiota has major influence on human physiology and modulates health and disease. Complex host-microbe interactions regulate various homeostatic processes, including metabolism and immune function, while disturbances in microbiota composition (dysbiosis) are associated with a plethora of human diseases and are believed to modulate disease initiation, progression and therapy response. The vast complexity of the human microbiota and its metabolic output represents a great challenge in unraveling the molecular basis of host-microbe interactions in specific physiological contexts. To increase our understanding of these interactions, functional microbiota research using animal models in a reductionistic setting are essential. In the dynamic landscape of gut microbiota research, the use of germ-free and gnotobiotic mouse technology, in which causal disease-driving mechanisms can be dissected, represents a pivotal investigative tool for functional microbiota research in health and disease, in which causal disease-driving mechanisms can be dissected. A better understanding of the health-modulating functions of the microbiota opens perspectives for improved therapies in many diseases. In this review, we discuss practical considerations for the design and execution of germ-free and gnotobiotic experiments, including considerations around germ-free rederivation and housing conditions, route and timing of microbial administration, and dosing protocols. This comprehensive overview aims to provide researchers with valuable insights for improved experimental design in the field of functional microbiota research.","Maude Jans, Lars Vereecke",The FEBS journal,2024,experimental design; germ‐free; gnotobiotic; microbiota,10.1111/febs.17124,"VIB Center for Inflammation Research, Ghent, Belgium.; VIB Center for Inflammation Research, Ghent, Belgium.",N/A,EOS-G0H2522N-40007505 (Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek); F/2020/1421 (Stichting Tegen Kanker); BOF.GOA031-22 (Bijzonder Onderzoeksfonds UGent); BOF.IBF037-20 (Bijzonder Onderzoeksfonds UGent),Journal Article; Review

38519930,Needs and feasibility of living systematic reviews (LSRs): Experience from LSRs on COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness.,"During 2021 and 2023, a team of researchers at the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) and partnering institutions conducted two living systematic reviews (LSRs) on the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in different age groups to inform recommendations of the Standing Committee on Vaccination in Germany (Ständige Impfkommission, STIKO). Based on our experience from the realization of these LSRs, we developed certain criteria to assess the needs and feasibility of conducting LSRs. Combining these with previously established criteria, we developed the following set to inform future planning of LSRs for STIKO: Needs criterion (N)1: Relevance of the research question, N2: Certainty of evidence (CoE) at baseline; N3: Expected need for Population-Intervention-Comparator-Outcome (PICO) adaptations; N4: Expected new evidence over time; N5: Expected impact of new evidence on CoE; Feasibility criterion (F)1: Availability of sufficient human resources; F2: Feasibility of timely dissemination of the results to inform decision-making. For each criterion we suggest rating options which may support the decision to conduct an LSR or other forms of evidence synthesis when following the provided flowchart. The suggested criteria were developed on the basis of the experiences from exemplary reviews in a specific research field (i.e., COVID-19 vaccination), and did not follow a formal development or validation process. However, these criteria might also be useful to assess whether questions from other research fields can and should be answered using the LSR approach, or assist in determining whether the use of an LSR is sensible and feasible for specific questions in health policy and practice.","Wiebe Külper-Schiek, Iris Thielemann, Antonia Pilic, Joerg J Meerpohl, Waldemar Siemens, Sabine Vygen-Bonnet, Judith Koch, Thomas Harder, Vanessa Piechotta","Zeitschrift fur Evidenz, Fortbildung und Qualitat im Gesundheitswesen",2024,COVID-19; Decision criteria; Entscheidungskriterien; Impfempfehlung; Impfung; Living Systematic Review; Living systematic review; Recommendation; Vaccination,10.1016/j.zefq.2024.01.003,"Immunization Unit, Robert Koch Institute, Berlin, Germany.; Immunization Unit, Robert Koch Institute, Berlin, Germany.; Immunization Unit, Robert Koch Institute, Berlin, Germany.; Institute for Evidence in Medicine, Medical Center- University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany; Cochrane Germany, Cochrane Germany Foundation, Freiburg, Germany.; Institute for Evidence in Medicine, Medical Center- University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany; Cochrane Germany, Cochrane Germany Foundation, Freiburg, Germany.; Immunization Unit, Robert Koch Institute, Berlin, Germany.; Immunization Unit, Robert Koch Institute, Berlin, Germany.; Immunization Unit, Robert Koch Institute, Berlin, Germany.; Immunization Unit, Robert Koch Institute, Berlin, Germany.

The respiratory system is constantly exposed to many environmental challenges, making it susceptible to various insults and infections. Regulatory T cells play essential roles in maintaining homeostasis in the lung and promoting repair after injury. Regulatory T cell function dysregulation can lead to inflammation, tissue damage, or aberrant repair. Research on regulatory T cell mechanisms in the lung has unveiled their influence on lung inflammation and repair mechanisms. In this review, our goal is to highlight the advances in regulatory T cell biology with respect to lung injury and resolution.

38518980,COVID-19 pandemic and the social determinants of health.,"Hesitancy to receive a COVID-19 vaccination across sub-groups within the US population contributed to higher illness rates and deaths. Specifically, minority groups and those living in rural and remote areas are more vaccine-hesitant populations known to suffer from higher disparities in health. Identifying successful and replicable approaches to promoting vaccination within these subpopulations is critical to ensuring vaccination rates can be maximized in these vulnerable groups. In this paper, we present findings from the Mississippi Recognizing Important Vaccine & Education Resources (RIVERs) project, a multi-state effort to spread accurate information related to COVID-19 vaccinations using a variety of community and media-based methods as well as provide vaccinations. Vaccination rates for Black people in Mississippi exceeded those of White people, likely due to the concerted effort of regional health and community organizations. Propensity score matching is performed to test intervention styles using spatial and temporal data related to approximately 7,000 events across Mississippi and parts of Tennessee and publicly available data on vaccination rates and socio-economic data. We demonstrate that vaccination rates within the vulnerable groups may be closely related to misinformation being spread through local social networks and that interventions carried out by local leaders with high levels of local social capital are best at quashing misinformation at the local level. We recommend that policymakers consider the importance of local efforts as an effective tool in increasing vaccination rates in future pandemics.","John E Meador, Wesley James, Joseph Branson, Jonathan Bennett, Karen Matthews",Frontiers in epidemiology,2023,COVID-19 vaccination; community; health; interventions; minority; rural,10.3389/fepid.2023.1139371,"Delta Health Alliance, Stoneville, MS, United States.; Center for Community Research and Evaluation, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN, United States.; Center for Community Research and Evaluation, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN, United States.; Center for Community Research and Evaluation, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN, United States.; Delta Health Alliance, Stoneville, MS, United States.",N/A,N/A,Journal Article

Reaching all children with full immunization services is critical to meet Nepal's commitment to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This study aimed to identify factors affecting compliance with childhood immunization in children aged 16 to 36 months in Nepal. A community-based unmatched case-control study was conducted with 250 (83 cases and 167 controls) respondents in the Ilam district of Nepal. Respondents were randomly selected using a multi-stage cluster sampling technique. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire and analysed using SPSS version 16 statistical software. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were done to identify the factors influencing compliance with childhood immunization of the sampled respondents. More than two-thirds (66.8%) of the sampled children were fully immunized, and 19.3% of the children defaulted to the Measles-Rubella vaccines. Only 19.2% of the respondents had good knowledge about the type of vaccine, and more than half (59.2%) of the respondents had a positive attitude towards immunization. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that lack of knowledge about vaccines (AOR = 49.4, 95% CI = 12.94 to 188.59), father's level of education (AOR = 2.1, 95% CI = 1.05 to 4.30), not getting immunization on the day of the appointment (AOR = 4.8, 95% CI = 2.30 to 9.89), lack of knowledge about immunization schedule (AOR = 2.4, 95% CI = 1.14 to 4.84), and negative attitude towards immunization (AOR = 2.1, 95% CI = 1.03 to 4.19) were independently impeded on compliance on the childhood immunization.

38515173,"TGF-β signaling in health, disease, and therapeutics.","Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β is a multifunctional cytokine expressed by almost every tissue and cell type. The signal transduction of TGF-β can stimulate diverse cellular responses and is particularly critical to embryonic development, wound healing, tissue homeostasis, and immune homeostasis in health. The dysfunction of TGF-β can play key roles in many diseases, and numerous targeted therapies have been developed to rectify its pathogenic activity. In the past decades, a large number of studies on TGF-β signaling have been carried out, covering a broad spectrum of topics in health, disease, and therapeutics. Thus, a comprehensive overview of TGF-β signaling is required for a general picture of the studies in this field. In this review, we retrace the research history of TGF-β and introduce the molecular mechanisms regarding its biosynthesis, activation, and signal transduction. We also provide deep insights into the functions of TGF-β signaling in physiological conditions as well as in pathological processes.

Since then, at least 16 new randomized controlled trials have contributed additional evidence, which necessitated a modification of most of the previous recommendations. We used again the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association methodology for assessment of level of evidence (LOE) and class of recommendation (COR). Five recommendations had the LOE upgraded to A and 2 new recommendations on antithrombotic treatment for patients with COVID-19 were added. Furthermore, a section was added to answer questions about COVID-19 vaccination and vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT), for which studies have provided some evidence. We only included recommendations with LOE A or B. Panelists agreed on 19 recommendations, 4 for nonhospitalized, 5 for noncritically ill hospitalized, 3 for critically ill hospitalized, and 2 for postdischarge patients, as well as 5 for vaccination and VITT. A strong recommendation (COR 1) was given for (a) use of prophylactic dose of low-molecular-weight heparin or unfractionated heparin in noncritically ill patients hospitalized for COVID-19, (b) for select patients in this group, use of therapeutic-dose low-molecular-weight heparin/unfractionated heparin in preference to prophylactic dose, and (c) for use of antiplatelet factor 4 enzyme immunoassays for diagnosing VITT. A strong recommendation was given against (COR 3) the addition of an antiplatelet agent in hospitalized, noncritically ill patients.

38496080,Epigenetic control of microglial immune responses.,"Microglia, the major population of brain-resident macrophages, are now recognized as a heterogeneous population comprising several cell subtypes with different (so far mostly supposed) functions in health and disease. A number of studies have performed molecular characterization of these different microglial activation states over the last years making use of ""omics"" technologies, that is transcriptomics, proteomics and, less frequently, epigenomics profiling. These approaches offer the possibility to identify disease mechanisms, discover novel diagnostic biomarkers, and develop new therapeutic strategies. Here, we focus on epigenetic profiling as a means to understand microglial immune responses beyond what other omics methods can offer, that is, revealing past and present molecular responses, gene regulatory networks and potential future response trajectories, and defining cell subtype-specific disease relevance through mapping non-coding genetic variants. We review the current knowledge in the field regarding epigenetic regulation of microglial identity and function, provide an exemplary analysis that demonstrates the advantages of performing joint transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling of single microglial cells and discuss how comprehensive epigenetic analyses may enhance our understanding of microglial pathophysiology.","Rebekka Scholz, Desirée Brösamle, Xidi Yuan, Marc Beyer, Jonas J Neher",Immunological reviews,2024,ATAC‐seq; Alzheimer; ChIP‐seq; aging; epigenetics; microglia,10.1111/imr.13317,"Immunogenomics & Neurodegeneration, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Bonn, Germany.; Biomedical Center (BMC), Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany.; Biomedical Center (BMC), Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany.; Immunogenomics & Neurodegeneration, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Bonn, Germany.; Biomedical Center (BMC), Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany.","Microglia; Epigenesis, Genetic; Humans; Animals; Epigenomics; Transcriptome; Immunity; Gene Regulatory Networks; Gene Expression Profiling; Brain",P1200024 (Gemeinnützige Hertie-Stiftung); 2018-A158 (Else Kröner-Fresenius-Stiftung); EXC 2151: project ID 390873048 (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft); GRK2168: project ID 272482170 (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft); SFB1454: project ID 432325352 (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft); EXC2145 (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft),Journal Article; Review

Herein, we followed prospectively a cohort of participant who received COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer BioNTech and Sputnik-Gameleya V). The goal of this follow-up was to define the humoral and cellular immunological profile after immunization by assessing neutralizing antibodies and IFN- γ release. 26 vaccinated health care workers by Pfizer BioNTech (n=12) and Sputnik-Gameleya V (n=14) were enrolled from June to December 2021 in Military hospital of Tunis. All consenting participants were sampled for peripheral blood after three weeks of vaccination. The humoral response was investigated by the titer of anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to S1 protein. The CD4 and CD8 T cell responses were evaluated by the QuantiFERON® SARS-CoV-2 (Qiagen® Basel, Switzerland). Regardless the type of vaccine, the assessment of humoral and cellular response following vaccination showed a strong involvement of the later with expression of IFN-γ as compared to antibodies secretion. Moreover, we showed that people with past SARS-CoV-2 infection developed high levels of antibodies than those who are not previously infected. However, no significant difference was detected concerning interferon gamma (IFN-γ) expression by CD4 and CD8 T cells in health care worker (HCW) previously infection or not with COVID-19 infection. Analysis of immune response according to the type of vaccine, we found that Pfizer BioNTech induced high level of humoral response (91.66%) followed by Sputnik-Gameleya V (64.28%). However, adenovirus vaccine gave a better cellular response (57.14%) than mRNA vaccine (41.66%). Regarding the immune response following vaccine doses, we revealed a significant increase of neutralizing antibodies and IFN-γ release by T cells in patients fully vaccinated as compared to those who have received just one vaccine. Collectively, our data revealed a similar immune response between Pfizer BioNTech and Sputnik-Gameleya V vaccine with a slight increase of humoral response by mRNA vaccine and cellular response by adenovirus vaccine. It's evident that past SARS-CoV-2 infection was a factor that contributed to the vaccination's increased immunogenicity. However, the administration of full doses of vaccines (Pfizer BioNTech or Sputnik-Gameleya V) induces better humoral and cellular responses detectable even more than three months following vaccination.","Nejla Stambouli, Khadija Bahrini, Chihebeddine Romdhani, Aicha Rebai, Sana Boughariou, Mohamed Zakraoui, Bilel Arfaoui, Sameh Seyli, Yasmine Boukhalfa, Riadh Battikh, Mohamed Ben Moussa, Iheb Labbene, Mustpha Ferjani, Hedi Gharssallah",Journal of immunological methods,2024,"Cellular response,vaccination; Humoral responses; Pfizer BioNTech; Sputnik-Gameleya V",10.1016/j.jim.2024.113665,"Research Unit UR17DN05, Military Hospital of Tunis, 1008 Montfleury, Tunis, Tunisia.; Research Unit UR17DN05, Military Hospital of Tunis, 1008 Montfleury, Tunis, Tunisia; University Tunis El Manar, Tunis, Tunisia.

38490578,Site-specific immobilization of the endosialidase reveals QSOX2 is a novel polysialylated protein.,"Polysialic acid (polySia) is a linear polymer of α2,8-linked sialic acid residues that is of fundamental biological interest due to its pivotal roles in the regulation of the nervous, immune, and reproductive systems in healthy human adults. PolySia is also dysregulated in several chronic diseases, including cancers and mental health disorders. However, the mechanisms underpinning polySia biology in health and disease remain largely unknown. The polySia-specific hydrolase, endoneuraminidase NF (EndoN), and the catalytically inactive polySia lectin EndoNDM, have been extensively used for studying polySia. However, EndoN is heat stable and remains associated with cells after washing. When studying polySia in systems with multiple polysialylated species, the residual EndoN that cannot be removed confounds data interpretation. We developed a strategy for site-specific immobilization of EndoN on streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. We showed that immobilizing EndoN allows for effective removal of the enzyme from samples, while retaining hydrolase activity. We used the same strategy to immobilize the polySia lectin EndoNDM, which enabled the enrichment of polysialylated proteins from complex mixtures such as serum for their identification via mass spectrometry. We used this methodology to identify a novel polysialylated protein, QSOX2, which is secreted from the breast cancer cell line MCF-7. This method of site-specific immobilization can be utilized for other enzymes and lectins to yield insight into glycobiology.","Carmanah Hunter, Tahlia Derksen, Sogand Makhsous, Matt Doll, Samantha Rodriguez Perez, Nichollas E Scott, Lisa M Willis",Glycobiology,2024,EndoN; biotinylation; protein immobilization; proteomics; sialic acid,10.1093/glycob/cwae026,"Department of Biological Sciences, University of Alberta, 116 St & 85 Ave, Edmonton, AB, T6G 2R3, Canada.; Department of Biological Sciences, University of Alberta, 116 St & 85 Ave, Edmonton, AB, T6G 2R3, Canada.; Department of Biological Sciences, University of Alberta, 116 St & 85 Ave, Edmonton, AB, T6G 2R3, Canada.; Department of Biological Sciences, University of Alberta, 116 St & 85 Ave, Edmonton, AB, T6G 2R3, Canada.; Department of Biological Sciences, University of Alberta, 116 St & 85 Ave, Edmonton, AB, T6G 2R3, Canada.; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC 3000, Australia.; Department of Biological Sciences, University of Alberta, 116 St & 85 Ave, Edmonton, AB, T6G 2R3, Canada.",Adult; Humans; Sialic Acids; Neuraminidase; Lectins; Oxidoreductases Acting on Sulfur Group Donors,RGPIN-2021-02888 (Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada); CD-87 (Canadian Glycomics Network),"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

38489580,Border-associated macrophages in the central nervous system.,"Tissue-resident macrophages play an important role in the local maintenance of homeostasis and immune surveillance. In the central nervous system (CNS), brain macrophages are anatomically divided into parenchymal microglia and non-parenchymal border-associated macrophages (BAMs). Among these immune cell populations, microglia have been well-studied for their roles during development as well as in health and disease. BAMs, mostly located in the choroid plexus, meningeal and perivascular spaces, are now gaining increased attention due to advancements in multi-omics technologies and genetic methodologies. Research on BAMs over the past decade has focused on their ontogeny, immunophenotypes, involvement in various CNS diseases, and potential as therapeutic targets. Unlike microglia, BAMs display mixed origins and distinct self-renewal capacity. BAMs are believed to regulate neuroimmune responses associated with brain barriers and contribute to immune-mediated neuropathology. Notably, BAMs have been observed to function in diverse cerebral pathologies, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, ischemic stroke, and gliomas. The elucidation of the heterogeneity and diverse functions of BAMs during homeostasis and neuroinflammation is mesmerizing, since it may shed light on the precision medicine that emphasizes deep insights into programming cues in the unique brain immune microenvironment. In this review, we delve into the latest findings on BAMs, covering aspects like their origins, self-renewal capacity, adaptability, and implications in different brain disorders.","Rui Sun, Haowu Jiang",Journal of neuroinflammation,2024,Border-associated macrophages; Brain; Cancer; Central nervous system; Microglia; Neurodegeneration,10.1186/s12974-024-03059-x,"Department of Neurological Surgery, Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, 660 S.

Drawing on current research, this article examines hurdles that malaria immunization may face to reach high-risk children and explores the policy implications. The analysis finds health system related risks with the potential to reduce the ability of malaria vaccines to provide equitable protection. Deployment of effective frameworks to tackle these risks so as to strengthen within-country equity and progress tracking should be entangled with the deployment of the vaccines. To capture more comprehensively disease- and system-related risks to child health and survival, vaccine allocation criteria should expand their data and indicator breadth. Factoring molecular, clinical, and epidemiological features of antimalarial drug resistance into vaccine allocation frameworks is critical to effectively reflect current and future risks to malaria control interventions. It is proposed that approximately 6-15 children would need to be vaccinated to prevent a malaria adverse outcome. Vaccine purchasing and delivery costs may overwhelm endemic countries' health systems given the sizeable number needed to vaccinate, the population of at-risk children, and limited government financing of the health sector. Innovations in health financing are pivotal to ensuring the cost-effectiveness and sustainability of immunization programs aiming to attain and maintain universal and equitable protection.",Floriano Amimo,BMC medicine,2024,"Childhood immunization; Health system; Malaria; Number needed to vaccinate; Plasmodium falciparum; R21/Matrix-M; RTS,S/AS01",10.1186/s12916-024-03321-2,"Faculty of Medicine, Eduardo Mondlane University, Maputo, Mozambique. florianoamimo@gmail.com.","Child; Humans; Infant; Malaria Vaccines; Malaria, Falciparum; Malaria; Immunization; Vaccination",N/A,Journal Article
38475775,Mitochondria in the Central Nervous System in Health and Disease: The Puzzle of the Therapeutic Potential of Mitochondrial Transplantation.,"Mitochondria, the energy suppliers of the cells, play a central role in a variety of cellular processes essential for survival or leading to cell death. Consequently, mitochondrial dysfunction is implicated in numerous general and CNS disorders. The clinical manifestations of mitochondrial dysfunction include metabolic disorders, dysfunction of the immune system, tumorigenesis, and neuronal and behavioral abnormalities. In this review, we focus on the mitochondrial role in the CNS, which has unique characteristics and is therefore highly dependent on the mitochondria. First, we review the role of mitochondria in neuronal development, synaptogenesis, plasticity, and behavior as well as their adaptation to the intricate connections between the different cell types in the brain. Then, we review the sparse knowledge of the mechanisms of exogenous mitochondrial uptake and describe attempts to determine their half-life and transplantation long-term effects on neuronal sprouting, cellular proteome, and behavior. We further discuss the potential of mitochondrial transplantation to serve as a tool to study the causal link between mitochondria and neuronal activity and behavior. Next, we describe mitochondrial transplantation's therapeutic potential in various CNS disorders. Finally, we discuss the basic and reverse-translation challenges of this approach that currently hinder the clinical use of mitochondrial transplantation.","Kuldeep Tripathi, Dorit Ben-Shachar",Cells,2024,CNS; mitochondria; mitochondria and behavior; mitochondrial transplantation; neural development and function; neuropsychiatric disorders,10.3390/cells13050410,"Laboratory of Psychobiology, Department of Neuroscience, The Ruth and Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, P.O.

Although highly regulated to maintain a stable output of blood cells in health, the haematopoietic system is capable of extensive remodelling in response to external challenges, prioritizing the production of certain cell types at the expense of others. In this Review, we consider how acute insults, such as infections and cytotoxic drug-induced myeloablation, cause molecular, cellular and metabolic changes in haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells at multiple levels of the haematopoietic hierarchy to drive accelerated production of the mature myeloid cells needed to resolve the initiating insult. Moreover, we discuss how dysregulation or subversion of these emergency myelopoiesis mechanisms contributes to the progression of chronic inflammatory diseases and cancer.","James W Swann, Oakley C Olson, Emmanuelle Passegué",Nature reviews.

In particular, hPSC-based human-animal brain chimeras enable the study of human cell pathophysiology in vivo. In chimeric brains, human neural and immune cells can maintain human-specific features, undergo maturation, and functionally integrate into host brains, allowing scientists to study how human cells impact neural circuits and animal behaviors. The emerging human-animal brain chimeras hold promise for modeling human brain cells and their interactions in health and disease, elucidating the disease mechanism from molecular and cellular to circuit and behavioral levels, and testing the efficacy of cell therapy interventions. Here, we discuss recent advances in the generation and applications of using human-animal chimeric brain models for the study of neurological disorders, including disease modeling and cell therapy.","Yanru Ji, Jenna Lillie McLean, Ranjie Xu",Neuroscience bulletin,2024,Cell therapy; Disease modeling; Human neurons and glia; Human pluripotent stem cell; Human–animal chimera; Microglia; Neurological disorder; Organoid,10.1007/s12264-024-01189-z,"Department of Basic Medical Sciences, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, 47907, USA.; Department of Basic Medical Sciences, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, 47907, USA.; Department of Basic Medical Sciences, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, 47907, USA. xu1726@purdue.edu.","Humans; Animals; Nervous System Diseases; Pluripotent Stem Cells; Chimera; Brain; Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy; Disease Models, Animal",N/A,Journal Article; Review
38466557,Metabolic regulation of type I interferon production.,"Over the past decade, there has been a surge in discoveries of how metabolic pathways regulate immune cell function in health and disease, establishing the field of immunometabolism. Specifically, pathways such as glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and those involving lipid metabolism have been implicated in regulating immune cell function. Viral infections cause immunometabolic changes which lead to antiviral immunity, but little is known about how metabolic changes regulate interferon responses. Interferons are critical cytokines in host defense, rapidly induced upon pathogen recognition, but are also involved in autoimmune diseases. This review summarizes how metabolic change impacts interferon production. We describe how glycolysis, lipid metabolism (specifically involving eicosanoids and cholesterol), and the TCA cycle-linked intermediates itaconate and fumarate impact type I interferons. Targeting these metabolic changes presents new therapeutic possibilities to modulate type I interferons during host defense or autoimmune disorders.","Shane M O'Carroll, Fiona D R Henkel, Luke A J O'Neill",Immunological reviews,2024,Immunometabolism; interferons; macrophage; metabolism,10.1111/imr.13318,"School of Biochemistry and Immunology, Trinity Biomedical Sciences Institute, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin 2, Ireland.; School of Biochemistry and Immunology, Trinity Biomedical Sciences Institute, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin 2, Ireland.; School of Biochemistry and Immunology, Trinity Biomedical Sciences Institute, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin 2, Ireland.",Humans; Interferon Type I; Animals; Lipid Metabolism; Glycolysis; Citric Acid Cycle; Virus Diseases; Autoimmune Diseases; Signal Transduction; Energy Metabolism,N/A,Journal Article; Review
38465724,Inverted apicobasal polarity in health and disease.,"Apicobasal epithelial polarity controls the functional properties of most organs. Thus, there has been extensive research on the molecular intricacies governing the establishment and maintenance of cell polarity. Whereas loss of apicobasal polarity is a well-documented phenomenon associated with multiple diseases, less is known regarding another type of apicobasal polarity alteration - the inversion of polarity. In this Review, we provide a unifying definition of inverted polarity and discuss multiple scenarios in mammalian systems and human health and disease in which apical and basolateral membrane domains are interchanged. This includes mammalian embryo implantation, monogenic diseases and dissemination of cancer cell clusters. For each example, the functional consequences of polarity inversion are assessed, revealing shared outcomes, including modifications in immune surveillance, altered drug sensitivity and changes in adhesions to neighboring cells. Finally, we highlight the molecular alterations associated with inverted apicobasal polarity and provide a molecular framework to connect these changes with the core cell polarity machinery and to explain roles of polarity inversion in health and disease. Based on the current state of the field, failure to respond to extracellular matrix (ECM) cues, increased cellular contractility and membrane trafficking defects are likely to account for most cases of inverted apicobasal polarity.","Nicolas Pasquier, Fanny Jaulin, Florent Peglion",Journal of cell science,2024,Apicobasal polarity; Embryo implantation; Extracellular matrix sensing; Membrane trafficking; Micropapillary cancer; Monogenic diseases,10.1242/jcs.261659,"Collective Invasion Team, Inserm U-1279, Gustave Roussy, Villejuif F-94805, France.; Collective Invasion Team, Inserm U-1279, Gustave Roussy, Villejuif F-94805, France.; Collective Invasion Team, Inserm U-1279, Gustave Roussy, Villejuif F-94805, France.",Animals; Humans; Epithelial Cells; Cell Membrane; Cell Polarity; Mammals,ANR-20-CE13-0031-01 (Agence Nationale de la Recherche); 2020-1-PLBIO-04-IGR-1 (Institut National du Cancer); 20CR046-00 (Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale),"Review; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

The objective of this study was to use a cohort of 40 dairy and dairy-beef female and male calves (27 females and 13 males) to determine serological responses to concurrent administration at 3 weeks of age (22 ± 4.85 days) of two commercially available intranasal (IN) vaccines for the viruses: bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine herpes virus 1 (BoHV-1), and parainfluenza-3-virus (PI3-V).

In parallel, the COVID-19 pandemic created declines in routine vaccination coverage for adults, adolescents, and children; particularly, in communities experiencing overlapping social disadvantage. Community-based efforts offer a solution to narrow immunization gaps but have not been replicated consistently nor demonstrated widespread success during the pandemic as evidenced by prevailing disparities in immunization uptake.

38460282,"""COVID is a huge jigsaw puzzle that I am trying to make sense of myself"": Exploring the perceptions towards the COVID-19 vaccine communication strategy in Australia amongst unvaccinated Australian adults.","The COVID-19 pandemic and the associated introduction of a novel vaccine has provided researchers with the opportunity to investigate how to support vaccine acceptance and reduce hesitancy using novel approaches. This study aimed to understand the perceptions of COVID-19 unvaccinated Australian adults towards the COVID-19 vaccines and the factors influencing their vaccine decision-making. We also explored their attitudes towards vaccine communication strategies and the availability and quality of resources to support decision-making and preferences during future public health emergencies. In-depth interviews were undertaken with 35 members of the Australian community who self-identified as being unvaccinated against COVID-19 from September to December 2021 and did not intend to vaccinate. Key themes that emerged focused on past experiences of vaccination, feelings of being coerced or pushed into vaccination, concerns about transparency around the development processes used for the COVID-19 vaccines, the value of getting vaccinated and issues regarding the mandates being used. Participants acknowledged that they would be open to talking to peers but held some reservations about the process. Requirements for vaccination have now been lifted in many countries. While governments should continue to strive to promote COVID-19 primary and booster vaccines going forward, this research suggests that there will be a small proportion of the community who continue to actively decline the vaccine. Further work is needed to understand the strategies that can support decision-making during pandemics amongst people who remain uncertain about the need for the vaccines or are concerned about vaccine safety. This includes innovatively exploring the role of peer-to-peer communication and the influence it may have on correcting misunderstandings and supporting confidence.","Joshua Karras, Mia Harrison, Maryke Steffens, Ikram Abdi, Holly Seale",Vaccine,2024,"Attitudes; COVID-19; Pandemic; Vaccine hesitancy, immunisation, communication",10.1016/j.vaccine.2024.03.004,"School of Population Health, Faculty of Medicine and Health, University of New South Wales, New South Wales, Australia.

Meanwhile, the common interaction of inner systems with the nutrient complex has not been well elucidated, which raises the scientific issue of the modulatory effect of the nutrient complex on immunity. The representative prebiotics of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), ginseng extract, and polydextrose (PDX) were selected on behalf of the classification of polyphenol, flavone or polysaccharides, and dietary fiber to generally cover the daily food intake in this study to explore their intervention in inflammation and macrophage polarization. The intervention of selected nutrients on inflammation and macrophage polarization has been evaluated against macrophages to unveil their comprehensive effects. The synergistic effect of selected nutrients was demonstrated by inhibiting M1 macrophage polarization and the promotion of M2 macrophage polarization. Then, the nutrient formula was set up to verify the intervention effect, and the results revealed the significant inhibition of cell inflammation and the effect on cell proliferation through promoting the cell cycle in the G2 phase. The nutrient complex could inhibit M1 macrophage polarization to inhibit M1-mediated inflammation and promote M2 macrophages for anti-inflammatory effect and enhance cell phagocytosis. Moreover, the varied intervention effects of the nutrient complex with different formulas could be summarized. In general, the formula containing EGCG, ginseng extract, and PDX was demonstrated to possess an enhanced immunomodulatory effect on cell inflammation and macrophage polarization, which could potentially inspire the investigation of complex nutrients in health and diseases.","Yi Wang, Yaozhong Hu, Zhenhua Niu, Xuejiao Zhang, Dancai Fan, Xuemeng Ji, Huan Lv, Shuo Wang, Yanrong Zhao",Frontiers in nutrition,2024,EGCG; ginseng extract; macrophage; nutrient complex; polydextrose,10.3389/fnut.2024.1370608,"Tianjin Key Laboratory of Food Science and Health, School of Medicine, Nankai University, Tianjin, China.; Tianjin Key Laboratory of Food Science and Health, School of Medicine, Nankai University, Tianjin, China.; Shanghai M-Action Health Technology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China.; Tianjin Key Laboratory of Food Science and Health, School of Medicine, Nankai University, Tianjin, China.; Tianjin Key Laboratory of Food Science and Health, School of Medicine, Nankai University, Tianjin, China.; Tianjin Key Laboratory of Food Science and Health, School of Medicine, Nankai University, Tianjin, China.; Tianjin Key Laboratory of Food Science and Health, School of Medicine, Nankai University, Tianjin, China.; Tianjin Key Laboratory of Food Science and Health, School of Medicine, Nankai University, Tianjin, China.; Shanghai M-Action Health Technology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China.",N/A,N/A,Journal Article

38444848,"A comprehensive UHPLC-MS/MS method for metabolomics profiling of signaling lipids: Markers of oxidative stress, immunity and inflammation.","Signaling lipids (SLs) play a crucial role in various signaling pathways, featuring diverse lipid backbone structures. Emerging evidence showing the biological significance and biomedical values of SLs has strongly spurred the advancement of analytical approaches aimed at profiling SLs. Nevertheless, the dramatic differences in endogenous abundances across lipid classes as well as multiple isomers within the same lipid class makes the development of a generic analytical method challenging. A better analytical method that combines comprehensive coverage and high sensitivity is needed to enable us to gain a deeper understanding of the biochemistry of these molecules in health and disease. In this study, we developed a fast and comprehensive targeted ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) method for profiling SLs. The platform enables analyses of 260 metabolites covering oxylipins (isoprostanes, prostaglandins and other oxidized lipids), free fatty acids, lysophospholipids, sphingoid bases (C16, C18), platelet activating factors (C16, C18), endocannabinoids and bile acids. Various validation parameters including linearity, limit of detection, limit of quantification, extraction recovery, matrix effect, intra-day and inter-day precision were used to characterize this method. Metabolite quantitation was successfully achieved in both NIST Standard Reference Material for human plasma (NIST SRM 1950) and pooled human plasma, with 109 and 144 metabolites quantitated. The quantitation results in NIST SRM 1950 plasma demonstrated good correlations with certified or previously reported values in published literature. This study introduced quantitative data for 37 SLs for the first time. Metabolite concentrations measured in NIST SRM 1950 will serve as essential reference data for facilitating interlaboratory comparisons. The methodology established here will be the cornerstone for in-depth profiling of signaling lipids across diverse biological samples and contexts.","Wei Yang, Johannes C Schoeman, Xinyu Di, Lieke Lamont, Amy C Harms, Thomas Hankemeier",Analytica chimica acta,2024,Bile acids; Endocannabinoids; Inflammation; Lysophospholipids; Oxylipins; SRM 1950,10.1016/j.aca.2024.342348,"Metabolomics and Analytics Center, Leiden Academic Centre of Drug Research, Leiden University, 2333 CC, Leiden, the Netherlands.; Metabolomics and Analytics Center, Leiden Academic Centre of Drug Research, Leiden University, 2333 CC, Leiden, the Netherlands.; Department of Molecular Physiology, Leiden Institute of Chemistry, Leiden University, 2333 CC, Leiden, the Netherlands.; Metabolomics and Analytics Center, Leiden Academic Centre of Drug Research, Leiden University, 2333 CC, Leiden, the Netherlands.; Metabolomics and Analytics Center, Leiden Academic Centre of Drug Research, Leiden University, 2333 CC, Leiden, the Netherlands.; Metabolomics and Analytics Center, Leiden Academic Centre of Drug Research, Leiden University, 2333 CC, Leiden, the Netherlands.

These labels allude to their inherent immune function, related to their macrophage lineage. However, beyond their classic innate immune responses, microglia also play physiological roles crucial for proper brain development and maintenance of adult brain homeostasis. Microglia sense both external and local stimuli through a variety of surface receptors. Thus, they might serve as integrative hubs at the interface between the external environment and the CNS, able to decode, filter, and buffer cues from outside, with the aim of preserving and maintaining brain homeostasis. In this perspective, we will cast a critical look at how these multiple microglial functions are acquired and coordinated, and we will speculate on their impact on human brain physiology and pathology.","Amanda Sierra, Veronique E Miron, Rosa C Paolicelli, Richard M Ransohoff",Cold Spring Harbor perspectives in biology,2024,N/A,10.1101/cshperspect.a041366,"Achucarro Basque Center for Neuroscience, Glial Cell Biology Laboratory, Science Park of UPV/EHU, E-48940 Leioa, Bizkaia, Spain amanda.sierra@achucarro.org rransohoff@thirdrockventures.com.; BARLO Multiple Sclerosis Centre, Keenan Research Centre for Biomedical Science at St. Michael's Hospital, Toronto M5B 1T8, Canada.; Department of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Biology and Medicine, University of Lausanne, CH-1005 Lausanne, Switzerland.; Third Rock Ventures, Boston, Massachusetts 02215, USA amanda.sierra@achucarro.org rransohoff@thirdrockventures.com.","Microglia; Humans; Animals; Central Nervous System; Homeostasis; Brain; Immunity, Innate",N/A,Journal Article; Review
38438189,Hepatitis B screening and knowledge among Chinese and Vietnamese students in Australia.,"Research has shown that there are significant gaps in hepatitis B knowledge among migrant communities who are at risk of hepatitis B, such as Chinese and Vietnamese communities. Many students studying within Australia come from countries with high prevalence of hepatitis B. However, there is very little research examining hepatitis B knowledge, screening, or vaccination among university students in Australia or worldwide. The aim of this paper was to measure both levels of and demographic differences in hepatitis B screening and knowledge among Chinese and Vietnamese students in Australia. Online surveys were completed by 112 Chinese- and 95 Vietnamese-identifying students in Australia, measuring knowledge of hepatitis B, engagement in screening and vaccination, and demographic characteristics. Results show that although engagement in screening and vaccination for hepatitis B was high, there were significant gaps in knowledge around transmission of hepatitis B. There were also some key demographic differences in screening and knowledge. For instance, those born in Australia were more likely to have been screened compared to those born Mainland China, Hong Kong, or Vietnam. Chinese students born in Australia had lower levels of knowledge compared to those born in Mainland China or Hong Kong. Among both samples, knowing someone living with hepatitis B was associated with higher levels of knowledge. Findings underscore the need for education-based interventions to address the significant gaps that exist in knowledge around hepatitis B, with a specific need for culturally appropriate resources in a range of languages to cater to the diverse communities who may be at risk of hepatitis B.","Elena Cama, Loren Brener, Timothy Broady, Robyn Horwitz, Defeng Jin, Hoang Minh Khoi Vu, K O E Wu, Carla Treloar",PloS one,2024,N/A,10.1371/journal.pone.0299224,"Centre for Social Research in Health, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.; Centre for Social Research in Health, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.; Centre for Social Research in Health, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.; Centre for Social Research in Health, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.; Centre for Social Research in Health, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.; Centre for Social Research in Health, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.; Centre for Social Research in Health, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.; Centre for Social Research in Health, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",Humans; Vietnam; Students; Australia; China; Hepatitis B,N/A,Journal Article
38437224,Outcome predictors of post-COVID conditions in the European Academy of Neurology COVID-19 registry.,"Several neurological manifestations are part of the post-COVID condition. We aimed to: (1) evaluate the 6-month outcome in the cohort of patients with neurological manifestations during the COVID-19 acute phase and surviving the infection, and find outcome predictors; (2) define the prevalence and type of neurological symptoms persistent at six months after the infection. Data source was an international registry of patients with COVID-19 infection and neurological symptoms, signs or diagnoses established by the European Academy of Neurology. Functional status at six-month follow-up was measured with the modified Rankin scale (mRS), and defined as: ""stable/improved"" if the mRS at six months was equal as or lower than the baseline score; ""worse"" if it was higher than the baseline score. By October 30, 2022, 1,003 lab-confirmed COVID-19 patients were followed up for a median of 6.5 months. Compared to their pre-morbid status, 522 patients (52%) were stable/improved, whereas 465 (46%) were worse (functional status missing for 16). Age, hospitalization, several pre-COVID-19 comorbidities, and COVID-19 general complications were predictors of a worse status. Amongst neurological manifestations, stroke carried the highest risk for worse outcome (OR 5.96), followed by hyperactive delirium (2.8), and peripheral neuropathies (2.37). On the other hand, hyposmia/hypogeusia (0.38), headache (0.40), myalgia (0.45), and COVID-19 vaccination (0.52) were predictors of a favourable prognosis. Persisting neurological symptoms or signs were reported by 316/1003 patients (31.5%), the commonest being fatigue (n = 133), and impaired memory or concentration (n = 103). Our study identified significant long-term prognostic predictors in patients with COVID-19 and neurological manifestations.","Maurizio Angelo Leone, Raimund Helbok, Elisa Bianchi, Clarissa Lin Yasuda, Maria Konti, Dauren Ramankulov, Maria Lolich, Arijana Lovrencic-Huzjan, Tibor Kovács, Carmel Armon, Maria Sofia Cotelli, Francesco Cavallieri, Oxana Grosu, Gordana Kiteva-Trenchevska, Ildefonso Rodriguez-Leyva, Marion Boldingh, Waldemar Brola, Luís F Maia, Mafalda Maria Laracho de Seabra, Eugenia Irene Davidescu, Bogdan Ovidiu Popescu, Svetlana Kopishinskaia, Claudio L A Bassetti, Elena Moro",Journal of neurology,2024,Neurological conditions; Outcome; Post-Covid; Prognosis,10.1007/s00415-024-12212-8,"Department of Neurosciences, Istituto Di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri IRCCS, Milan, Italy. maurizio.leone@marionegri.it.; Department of Neurology, Neurocritical Care Unit, Vienna, Austria. raimund.helbok@kepleruniklinikum.at.; Department of Neurosciences, Istituto Di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri IRCCS, Milan, Italy.; University of Campinas, Campinas, Brazil.; European Academy of Neurology, Vienna, Austria.; European Academy of Neurology, Vienna, Austria.; European Academy of Neurology, Vienna, Austria.; Department of Neurology, UHC Sestre Milosrdnice University Hospital Center, Zagreb, Croatia.; Department of Neurology, Semmelweis University Budapest, Budapest, Hungary.; Tel Aviv University School of Medicine and Shamir (Assaf Harofeh), Medical Center, Tel Aviv, Israel.; Neurology Unit ASST Valcamonica-Esine, Brescia, Italy.; Neurology Unit, Neuromotor and Rehabilitation Department, Azienda USL-IRCCS Di Reggio Emilia, Reggio Emilia, Italy.; Diomid Gherman Institute of Neurology and Neurosurgery, Chișinău, Moldova.; Medical Faculty, University Clinic for Neurology, University ""Ss.

38425722,Intestinal stem cells: guardians of homeostasis in health and aging amid environmental challenges.,"The intestinal epithelium is the first line of defense and acts as an interface between the vast microbial world within the gastrointestinal tract and the body's internal milieu. The intestinal epithelium not only facilitates nutrient absorption but also plays a key role in defending against pathogens and regulating the immune system. Central to maintaining a healthy epithelium are intestinal stem cells (ISCs), which are essential for replenishing the intestinal epithelium throughout an individual's lifespan. Recent research has unveiled the intricate interplay between ISCs and their niche, which includes various cell types, extracellular components, and signaling molecules. In this review, we delve into the most recent advances in ISC research, with a focus on the roles of ISCs in maintaining mucosal homeostasis and how ISC functionality is influenced by the niche environment. In this review, we explored the regulatory mechanisms that govern ISC behavior, emphasizing the dynamic adaptability of the intestinal epithelium in the face of various challenges. Understanding the intricate regulation of ISCs and the impact of aging and environmental factors is crucial for advancing our knowledge and developing translational approaches. Future studies should investigate the interactive effects of different risk factors on intestinal function and develop strategies for improving the regenerative capacity of the gut.","Jiahn Choi, Leonard H Augenlicht",Experimental & molecular medicine,2024,N/A,10.1038/s12276-024-01179-1,"Department of Cell Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, USA. jiahn.choi@einsteinmed.edu.; Department of Cell Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, USA.",Intestinal Mucosa; Stem Cells; Signal Transduction; Homeostasis,T32 AG023475 (NIA NIH HHS); R01 CA222358 (NCI NIH HHS); R01 CA229216 (NCI NIH HHS); R01 CA214625 (NCI NIH HHS); P30 AG038072 (NIA NIH HHS),Journal Article; Review
38424189,Nucleosides are overlooked fuels in central carbon metabolism.,"From our daily nutrition and synthesis within cells, nucleosides enter the bloodstream and circulate throughout the body and tissues. Nucleosides and nucleotides are classically viewed as precursors of nucleic acids, but recently they have emerged as a novel energy source for central carbon metabolism. Through catabolism by nucleoside phosphorylases, the ribose sugar group is released and can provide substrates for lower steps in glycolysis. In environments with limited glucose, such as at sites of infection or in the tumor microenvironment (TME), cells can use, and may even require, this alternative energy source. Here, we discuss the implications of these new findings in health and disease and speculate on the potential new roles of nucleosides and nucleic acids in energy metabolism.","Abigail Strefeler, Joan Blanco-Fernandez, Alexis A Jourdain",Trends in endocrinology and metabolism: TEM,2024,Metabolism; UPP1; cancer; immunity; uridine; uridinolysis,10.1016/j.tem.2024.01.013,"Department of Immunobiology, University of Lausanne, Ch. des Boveresses 155, CP51, 1066 Epalinges, Switzerland.; Department of Immunobiology, University of Lausanne, Ch. des Boveresses 155, CP51, 1066 Epalinges, Switzerland.; Department of Immunobiology, University of Lausanne, Ch. des Boveresses 155, CP51, 1066 Epalinges, Switzerland.

Inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) function has recently been approved as a cancer treatment strategy. Hence, it is important to understand how regulators of HIF may affect tumor growth under physiological conditions. Here we report that in aging mice factor-inhibiting HIF (FIH), one of the most studied negative regulators of HIF, is a haploinsufficient suppressor of spontaneous B cell lymphomas, particular pulmonary B cell lymphomas. FIH deficiency alters immune composition in aged mice and creates a tumor-supportive immune environment demonstrated in syngeneic mouse tumor models. Mechanistically, FIH-defective myeloid cells acquire tumor-supportive properties in response to signals secreted by cancer cells or produced in the tumor microenvironment with enhanced arginase expression and cytokine-directed migration. Together, these data demonstrate that under physiological conditions, FIH plays a key role in maintaining immune homeostasis and can suppress tumorigenesis through a cell-extrinsic pathway.","Jingyi Ma, Khatoun Al Moussawi, Hantao Lou, Hok Fung Chan, Yihua Wang, Joseph Chadwick, Chansavath Phetsouphanh, Elizabeth A Slee, Shan Zhong, Thomas M Leissing, Andrew Roth, Xiao Qin, Shuo Chen, Jie Yin, Indrika Ratnayaka, Yang Hu, Pakavarin Louphrasitthiphol, Lewis Taylor, Paulo J G Bettencourt, Mary Muers, David R Greaves, Helen McShane, Robert Goldin, Elizabeth J Soilleux, Mathew L Coleman, Peter J Ratcliffe, Xin Lu",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2024,B cell lymphoma; factor-inhibiting HIF; hypoxia-inducible factor; tumor microenvironment; tumor suppression,10.1073/pnas.2309957121,"Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 7DQ, United Kingdom.; Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 7DQ, United Kingdom.; Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 7DQ, United Kingdom.; Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 7DQ, United Kingdom.; Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 7DQ, United Kingdom.; Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 7DQ, United Kingdom.; Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 7DQ, United Kingdom.; Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 7DQ, United Kingdom.; Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 7DQ, United Kingdom.; Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 7DQ, United Kingdom.; Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 7DQ, United Kingdom.; Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 7DQ, United Kingdom.; Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 7DQ, United Kingdom.; Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 7DQ, United Kingdom.; Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 7DQ, United Kingdom.; Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 7DQ, United Kingdom.; Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 7DQ, United Kingdom.; Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford, Oxford OX1 3RE, United Kingdom.; The Jenner Institute, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 7DQ, United Kingdom.; Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 7DQ, United Kingdom.; Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford, Oxford OX1 3RE, United Kingdom.; The Jenner Institute, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 7DQ, United Kingdom.; Department of Metabolism, Digestion and Reproduction, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, London W2 1NY, United Kingdom.; Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1QP, United Kingdom.; Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, United Kingdom.; Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 7DQ, United Kingdom.; Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 7DQ, United Kingdom.","Animals; Mice; Hypoxia; Lymphoma, B-Cell; Mixed Function Oxygenases; Repressor Proteins; Tumor Microenvironment",Core grant (Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research (LICR)); RG/15/10/31485 (British Heart Foundation (BHF)),Journal Article
38422022,"Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, and Regulation of Immunity: Challenges and Opportunities.","The immune system is regulated by a complex set of genetic, molecular, and cellular interactions. Rapid advances in the study of immunity and its network of interactions have been boosted by a spectrum of ""omics"" technologies that have generated huge amounts of data that have reached the status of big data (BD). With recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI), theoretical and clinical breakthroughs could emerge. Analyses of large data sets with AI tools will allow the formulation of new testable hypotheses open new research avenues and provide innovative strategies for regulating immunity and treating immunological diseases. This includes diagnosis and identification of rare diseases, prevention and treatment of autoimmune diseases, allergic disorders, infectious diseases, metabolomic disorders, cancer, and organ transplantation. However, ethical and regulatory challenges remain as to how these studies will be used to advance our understanding of basic immunology and how immunity might be regulated in health and disease. This will be particularly important for entities in which the complexity of interactions occurring at the same time and multiple cellular pathways have eluded conventional approaches to understanding and treatment. The analyses of BD by AI are likely to be complicated as both positive and negative outcomes of regulating immunity may have important ethical ramifications that need to be considered. We suggest there is an immediate need to develop guidelines as to how the analyses of immunological BD by AI tools should guide immune-based interventions to treat various diseases, prevent infections, and maintain health within an ethical framework.","Bhagirath Singh, Anthony M Jevnikar, Eric Desjardins",Archivum immunologiae et therapiae experimentalis,2024,Artificial intelligence; Big data; Ethics of immunotherapy; Omics; Precision medicine; Regulation of immunity,10.2478/aite-2024-0006,"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Western Ontario, London, ON, Canada.; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Western Ontario, London, ON, Canada.; Rotman Institute of Philosophy, University of Western Ontario, London, ON, Canada.",Humans; Artificial Intelligence; Big Data; Autoimmune Diseases; Cell Communication; Hypersensitivity,N/A,Journal Article; Review
38421272,"Bacteria-derived extracellular vesicles: endogenous roles, therapeutic potentials and their biomimetics for the treatment and prevention of sepsis.","Sepsis is one of the medical conditions with a high mortality rate and lacks specific treatment despite several years of extensive research. Bacterial extracellular vesicles (bEVs) are emerging as a focal target in the pathophysiology and treatment of sepsis. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from pathogenic microorganisms carry pathogenic factors such as carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, and virulence factors and are regarded as ""long-range weapons"" to trigger an inflammatory response. In particular, the small size of bEVs can cross the blood-brain and placental barriers that are difficult for pathogens to cross, deliver pathogenic agents to host cells, activate the host immune system, and possibly accelerate the bacterial infection process and subsequent sepsis. Over the years, research into host-derived EVs has increased, leading to breakthroughs in cancer and sepsis treatments. However, related approaches to the role and use of bacterial-derived EVs are still rare in the treatment of sepsis. Herein, this review looked at the dual nature of bEVs in sepsis by highlighting their inherent functions and emphasizing their therapeutic characteristics and potential.

We conducted a longitudinal analysis of the immune response elicited after three doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine in individuals who have previously experienced SARS-CoV-2 infection and in unexperienced ones. We conducted immunological analyses and single-cell transcriptomics of circulating T and B lymphocytes, combined to CITE-seq or LIBRA-seq, and VDJ-seq. We found that antibody levels against SARS-CoV-2 Spike, NTD and RBD from wild-type, delta and omicron VoCs show comparable dynamics in both vaccination groups, with a peak after the second dose, a decline after six months and a restoration after the booster dose. The antibody neutralization activity was maintained, with lower titers against the omicron variant. Spike-specific memory B cell response was sustained over the vaccination schedule. Clonal analysis revealed that Spike-specific B cells were polyclonal, with a partial clone conservation from natural infection to vaccination. Spike-specific T cell responses were oriented towards effector and effector memory phenotypes, with similar trends in unexperienced and experienced individuals. The CD8 T cell compartment showed a higher clonal expansion and persistence than CD4 T cells. The first two vaccinations doses tended to induce new clones rather than promoting expansion of pre-existing clones. However, we identified a fraction of Spike-specific CD8 T cell clones persisting from natural infection that were boosted by vaccination and clones specifically induced by vaccination. Collectively, our observations revealed a moderate effect of the second dose in enhancing the immune responses elicited after the first vaccination. Differently, we found that a third dose was necessary to restore comparable levels of neutralizing antibodies and Spike-specific T and B cell responses in individuals who experienced a natural SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Eugenia Galeota, Valeria Bevilacqua, Andrea Gobbini, Paola Gruarin, Mauro Bombaci, Elisa Pesce, Andrea Favalli, Andrea Lombardi, Francesca Vincenti, Jessica Ongaro, Tanya Fabbris, Serena Curti, Martina Martinovic, Mirco Toccafondi, Mariangela Lorenzo, Angelica Critelli, Francesca Clemente, Mariacristina Crosti, Maria Lucia Sarnicola, Manuele Martinelli, Lucia La Sala, Alejandro Espadas, Lorena Donnici, Maria Orietta Borghi, Tullia De Feo, Raffaele De Francesco, Daniele Prati, Pier Luigi Meroni, Samuele Notarbartolo, Jens Geginat, Andrea Gori, Alessandra Bandera, Sergio Abrignani, Renata Grifantini","Clinical immunology (Orlando, Fla.)",2024,SARS-CoV-2 vaccination;

38414114,Comparative transcriptomics coupled to developmental grading via transgenic zebrafish reporter strains identifies conserved features in neutrophil maturation.,"Neutrophils are evolutionarily conserved innate immune cells playing pivotal roles in host defense. Zebrafish models have contributed substantially to our understanding of neutrophil functions but similarities to human neutrophil maturation have not been systematically characterized, which limits their applicability to studying human disease. Here we show, by generating and analysing transgenic zebrafish strains representing distinct neutrophil differentiation stages, a high-resolution transcriptional profile of neutrophil maturation. We link gene expression at each stage to characteristic transcription factors, including C/ebp-β, which is important for late neutrophil maturation. Cross-species comparison of zebrafish, mouse, and human samples confirms high molecular similarity of immature stages and discriminates zebrafish-specific from pan-species gene signatures. Applying the pan-species neutrophil maturation signature to RNA-sequencing data from human neuroblastoma patients reveals association between metastatic tumor cell infiltration in the bone marrow and an overall increase in mature neutrophils. Our detailed neutrophil maturation atlas thus provides a valuable resource for studying neutrophil function at different stages across species in health and disease.","Stefanie Kirchberger, Mohamed R Shoeb, Daria Lazic, Andrea Wenninger-Weinzierl, Kristin Fischer, Lisa E Shaw, Filomena Nogueira, Fikret Rifatbegovic, Eva Bozsaky, Ruth Ladenstein, Bernd Bodenmiller, Thomas Lion, David Traver, Matthias Farlik, Christian Schöfer, Sabine Taschner-Mandl, Florian Halbritter, Martin Distel",Nature communications,2024,N/A,10.1038/s41467-024-45802-1,"St. Anna Children's Cancer Research Institute (CCRI), Vienna, Austria. stefanie.kirchberger@ccri.at.; St. Anna Children's Cancer Research Institute (CCRI), Vienna, Austria.; St. Anna Children's Cancer Research Institute (CCRI), Vienna, Austria.; St. Anna Children's Cancer Research Institute (CCRI), Vienna, Austria.; St. Anna Children's Cancer Research Institute (CCRI), Vienna, Austria.; Medical University of Vienna, Department of Dermatology, Vienna, Austria.; St. Anna Children's Cancer Research Institute (CCRI), Vienna, Austria.; St. Anna Children's Cancer Research Institute (CCRI), Vienna, Austria.; St. Anna Children's Cancer Research Institute (CCRI), Vienna, Austria.; St. Anna Children's Cancer Research Institute (CCRI), Vienna, Austria.; Department of Quantitative Biomedicine, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.; St. Anna Children's Cancer Research Institute (CCRI), Vienna, Austria.; Cell and Developmental Biology, University of California, San Diego, CA, USA.; Medical University of Vienna, Department of Dermatology, Vienna, Austria.; Medical University of Vienna, Division of Cell and Developmental Biology, Center for Anatomy and Cell Biology, Vienna, Austria.; St. Anna Children's Cancer Research Institute (CCRI), Vienna, Austria.; St. Anna Children's Cancer Research Institute (CCRI), Vienna, Austria. florian.halbritter@ccri.at.; St. Anna Children's Cancer Research Institute (CCRI), Vienna, Austria. martin.distel@ccri.at.","Animals; Humans; Mice; Neutrophils; Zebrafish; Animals, Genetically Modified; Bone Marrow; Gene Expression Profiling",N/A,Journal Article
38413586,The neutrophil-osteogenic cell axis promotes bone destruction in periodontitis.,"The immune-stromal cell interactions play a key role in health and diseases. In periodontitis, the most prevalent infectious disease in humans, immune cells accumulate in the oral mucosa and promote bone destruction by inducing receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL) expression in osteogenic cells such as osteoblasts and periodontal ligament cells. However, the detailed mechanism underlying immune-bone cell interactions in periodontitis is not fully understood. Here, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis on mouse periodontal lesions and showed that neutrophil-osteogenic cell crosstalk is involved in periodontitis-induced bone loss. The periodontal lesions displayed marked infiltration of neutrophils, and in silico analyses suggested that the neutrophils interacted with osteogenic cells through cytokine production. Among the cytokines expressed in the periodontal neutrophils, oncostatin M (OSM) potently induced RANKL expression in the primary osteoblasts, and deletion of the OSM receptor in osteogenic cells significantly ameliorated periodontitis-induced bone loss. Epigenomic data analyses identified the OSM-regulated RANKL enhancer region in osteogenic cells, and mice lacking this enhancer showed decreased periodontal bone loss while maintaining physiological bone metabolism. These findings shed light on the role of neutrophils in bone regulation during bacterial infection, highlighting the novel mechanism underlying osteoimmune crosstalk.","Yutaro Ando, Masayuki Tsukasaki, Nam Cong-Nhat Huynh, Shizao Zang, Minglu Yan, Ryunosuke Muro, Kazutaka Nakamura, Masatsugu Komagamine, Noriko Komatsu, Kazuo Okamoto, Kenta Nakano, Tadashi Okamura, Akira Yamaguchi, Kazuyuki Ishihara, Hiroshi Takayanagi",International journal of oral science,2024,N/A,10.1038/s41368-023-00275-8,"Department of Immunology, Graduate School of Medicine and Faculty of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1, Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.; Department of Osteoimmunology, Graduate School of Medicine and Faculty of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1, Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan. tsuka-im@m.u-tokyo.ac.jp.; Department of Immunology, Graduate School of Medicine and Faculty of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1, Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.; Department of Immunology, Graduate School of Medicine and Faculty of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1, Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.; Department of Immunology, Graduate School of Medicine and Faculty of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1, Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.; Department of Immunology, Graduate School of Medicine and Faculty of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1, Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.; Department of Immunology, Graduate School of Medicine and Faculty of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1, Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.; Department of Immunology, Graduate School of Medicine and Faculty of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1, Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.; Department of Immunology, Graduate School of Medicine and Faculty of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1, Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.; Department of Osteoimmunology, Graduate School of Medicine and Faculty of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1, Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.; Department of Laboratory Animal Medicine, Research Institute, National Center for Global Health and Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.; Department of Laboratory Animal Medicine, Research Institute, National Center for Global Health and Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.; Oral Health Science Center, Tokyo Dental College, 2-9-18, Kanda-Misaki-cho, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, Japan.; Department of Microbiology, Tokyo Dental College, 2-1-14 Kanda-Misaki-cho, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, Japan.; Department of Immunology, Graduate School of Medicine and Faculty of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1, Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan. takayana@m.u-tokyo.ac.jp.",Humans; Mice; Animals; Neutrophils; Periodontitis; Cytokines; Alveolar Bone Loss; Osteogenesis; RANK Ligand,JP20ek0410073 (Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED)); JP23ek0410108 (Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED)); JP22ek0410100 (Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED)),Journal Article

38410517,Unraveling the microbiome-metabolome nexus: a comprehensive study protocol for personalized management of Behçet's disease using explainable artificial intelligence.,"The presented study protocol outlines a comprehensive investigation into the interplay among the human microbiota, volatilome, and disease biomarkers, with a specific focus on Behçet's disease (BD) using methods based on explainable artificial intelligence. The protocol is structured in three phases. During the initial three-month clinical study, participants will be divided into control and experimental groups. The experimental groups will receive a soluble fiber-based dietary supplement alongside standard therapy. Data collection will encompass oral and fecal microbiota, breath samples, clinical characteristics, laboratory parameters, and dietary habits. The subsequent biological data analysis will involve gas chromatography, mass spectrometry, and metagenetic analysis to examine the volatilome and microbiota composition of salivary and fecal samples. Additionally, chemical characterization of breath samples will be performed. The third phase introduces Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) for the analysis of the collected data. This novel approach aims to evaluate eubiosis and dysbiosis conditions, identify markers associated with BD, dietary habits, and the supplement. Primary objectives include establishing correlations between microbiota, volatilome, phenotypic BD characteristics, and identifying patient groups with shared features. The study aims to identify taxonomic units and metabolic markers predicting clinical outcomes, assess the supplement's impact, and investigate the relationship between dietary habits and patient outcomes. This protocol contributes to understanding the microbiome's role in health and disease and pioneers an XAI-driven approach for personalized BD management. With 70 recruited BD patients, XAI algorithms will analyze multi-modal clinical data, potentially revolutionizing BD management and paving the way for improved patient outcomes.","Sabina Tangaro, Giuseppe Lopalco, Daniele Sabella, Vincenzo Venerito, Pierfrancesco Novielli, Donato Romano, Alessia Di Gilio, Jolanda Palmisani, Gianluigi de Gennaro, Pasquale Filannino, Rosanna Latronico, Roberto Bellotti, Maria De Angelis, Florenzo Iannone",Frontiers in microbiology,2024,Behçet’s disease; autoinflammatory disease; butyrate; explainable artificial intelligence; gut; innate immunity; microbiome; volatilome,10.3389/fmicb.2024.1341152,"Dipartimento di Scienze del Suolo, della Pianta e degli Alimenti, Università degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro, Bari, Italy.; Dipartimento di Medicina di Precisione e Rigenerativa e Area Jonica, Università degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro, Bari, Italy.; Dipartimento di Medicina di Precisione e Rigenerativa e Area Jonica, Università degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro, Bari, Italy.; Dipartimento di Medicina di Precisione e Rigenerativa e Area Jonica, Università degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro, Bari, Italy.; Dipartimento di Scienze del Suolo, della Pianta e degli Alimenti, Università degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro, Bari, Italy.; Dipartimento di Scienze del Suolo, della Pianta e degli Alimenti, Università degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro, Bari, Italy.; Dipartimento di Bioscienze, Biotecnologie e Ambiente, Università degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro, Bari, Italy.; Dipartimento di Bioscienze, Biotecnologie e Ambiente, Università degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro, Bari, Italy.; Dipartimento di Bioscienze, Biotecnologie e Ambiente, Università degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro, Bari, Italy.; Dipartimento di Scienze del Suolo, della Pianta e degli Alimenti, Università degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro, Bari, Italy.; Dipartimento di Scienze del Suolo, della Pianta e degli Alimenti, Università degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro, Bari, Italy.; Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare, Sezione di Bari, Bari, Italy.; Dipartimento di Scienze del Suolo, della Pianta e degli Alimenti, Università degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro, Bari, Italy.; Dipartimento di Medicina di Precisione e Rigenerativa e Area Jonica, Università degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro, Bari, Italy.",N/A,N/A,Journal Article

Animal models are helpful in examining human health disparities because many stress-induced human health conditions can be recapitulated using mouse models. Azoxymethane (AOM)/ dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) treatment can be used to model colitis-associated cancers. While colitis-associated cancers account for only 2% of colon cancers, the AOM/DSS model is useful for examining links between inflammation, immunity, and colon cancer. Mice were housed in enriched and impoverished environments for 1-month prior to behavioral testing. Following behavioral testing the mice were subjected to the AOM/DSS model. While our analysis revealed no significant behavioral variances between the impoverished and enriched housing conditions, we found significant effects in tumorigenesis. Enriched mice had fewer tumors and smaller tumor volumes compared to impoverished mice. African Americans are at higher risk for early onset colorectal cancers in part due to social economic status. Furthermore, housing conditions and environment may reflect social economic status. Research aimed at understanding links between social economic status and colorectal cancer progression is important for eliminating disparities in health outcomes.","Delawrence J Sykes, Sumeet Solanki, Sahiti Chukkapalli, Keyonna Williams, Erika A Newman, Kenneth Resnicow, Yatrik M Shah",bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology,2024,N/A,10.1101/2024.02.13.580099,N/A,N/A,N/A,Preprint

38390942,Fine needle aspiration of human lymph nodes reveals cell populations and soluble interactors pivotal to immunological priming.,"Lymph node (LN) fine needle aspiration (LN FNA) represents a powerful technique for minimally invasive sampling of human LNs in vivo and has been used effectively to directly study aspects of the human germinal center response. However, systematic deep phenotyping of the cellular populations and cell-free proteins recovered by LN FNA has not been performed. Thus, we studied human cervical LN FNAs as a proof-of-concept and used single-cell RNA-sequencing and proteomic analysis to benchmark this compartment, define the purity of LN FNA material, and facilitate future studies in this immunologically pivotal environment. Our data provide evidence that LN FNAs contain bone-fide LN-resident innate immune populations, with minimal contamination of blood material. Examination of these populations reveals unique biology not predictable from equivalent blood-derived populations. LN FNA supernatants represent a specific source of lymph- and lymph node-derived proteins, and can, aided by transcriptomics, identify likely receptor-ligand interactions. This represents the first description of the types and abundance of immune cell populations and cell-free proteins that can be efficiently studied by LN FNA.

38388988,The conneXion between sex and immune responses.,"There are notable sex-based differences in immune responses to pathogens and self-antigens, with female individuals exhibiting increased susceptibility to various autoimmune diseases, and male individuals displaying preferential susceptibility to some viral, bacterial, parasitic and fungal infections. Although sex hormones clearly contribute to sex differences in immune cell composition and function, the presence of two X chromosomes in female individuals suggests that differential gene expression of numerous X chromosome-linked immune-related genes may also influence sex-biased innate and adaptive immune cell function in health and disease. Here, we review the sex differences in immune system composition and function, examining how hormones and genetics influence the immune system. We focus on the genetic and epigenetic contributions responsible for altered X chromosome-linked gene expression, and how this impacts sex-biased immune responses in the context of pathogen infection and systemic autoimmunity.","Katherine S Forsyth, Nikhil Jiwrajka, Claudia D Lovell, Natalie E Toothacre, Montserrat C Anguera",Nature reviews.

This phenomenon may impair the development of effective neutralizing antibodies against variants of concern (VoCs), mainly Omicron and its subvariants. Consequently, the boost doses with bivalent vaccines have not shown a significant gain of function regarding the neutralization of Omicron. The approach to design COVID-19 vaccines must be revised to improve the effectiveness against VoCs. Here, we took advantage of the self-amplifying characteristic of RepRNA and developed a polyvalent formulation composed of mRNA from five VoCs. LION/RepRNA Polyvalent induced neutralizing antibodies in mice previously immunized with LION/RepRNA D614G and reduced the imprinted phenotype associated with low neutralization capacity of Omicron B.1.1.529 pseudoviruses.

Before the pandemic, marriage and birth rates were decreasing, while divorce and death rates were increasing, with only the trend in birth rates being statistically significant. The immediate effect of the pandemic was a significant decrease in the divorce rate, but there were non-significant effects on birth and marriage rates. However, in the months following the onset of the pandemic, there was a statistically significant sustained effect on increasing death and divorce rates. Forecasts based on pre-pandemic data showed that by the end of 2020, marriage, divorce, death, and birth rates were higher compared to pre-pandemic levels. In conclusion, the pandemic has greatly impacted society, particularly in terms of death and divorce rates. Birth rates were not immediately affected to the time lag between decisions and actual births. Fear of COVID-19 may have increased death rates as people avoided seeking medical help. Vaccination and effective treatment strategies are vital in reducing the pandemic's impact on mortality.

38368489,"Temporal changes of gene expression in health, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder.","The molecular events underlying the development, manifestation, and course of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder span from embryonic life to advanced age. However, little is known about the early dynamics of gene expression in these disorders due to their relatively late manifestation. To address this, we conducted a secondary analysis of post-mortem prefrontal cortex datasets using bioinformatics and machine learning techniques to identify differentially expressed gene modules associated with aging and the diseases, determine their time-perturbation points, and assess enrichment with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) genes. Our findings revealed early, mid, and late deregulation of expression of functional gene modules involved in neurodevelopment, plasticity, homeostasis, and immune response. This supports the hypothesis that multiple hits throughout life contribute to disease manifestation rather than a single early-life event. Moreover, the time-perturbed functional gene modules were associated with genetic loci affecting gene expression, highlighting the role of genetic factors in gene expression dynamics and the development of disease phenotypes. Our findings emphasize the importance of investigating time-dependent perturbations in gene expression before the age of onset in elucidating the molecular mechanisms of psychiatric disorders.","Arsen Arakelyan, Susanna Avagyan, Aleksey Kurnosov, Tigran Mkrtchyan, Gohar Mkrtchyan, Roksana Zakharyan, Karine R Mayilyan, Hans Binder","Schizophrenia (Heidelberg, Germany)",2024,N/A,10.1038/s41537-024-00443-7,"Institute of Molecular Biology NAS RA, Yerevan, Armenia. aarakelyan@sci.am.; Armenian Bioinformatics Institute, Yerevan, Armenia.; Armenian Bioinformatics Institute, Yerevan, Armenia.; Institute of Biomedicine and Pharmacy, Russian-Armenian University, Yerevan, Armenia.; Institute of Molecular Biology NAS RA, Yerevan, Armenia.; Institute of Molecular Biology NAS RA, Yerevan, Armenia.; Institute of Molecular Biology NAS RA, Yerevan, Armenia.; Armenian Bioinformatics Institute, Yerevan, Armenia.",N/A,22IMB-I-1F (State Committee of Science (Armenian State Committee of Science)); 23IMB-I-1F (State Committee of Science (Armenian State Committee of Science)); 22IMB-I-1F (State Committee of Science (Armenian State Committee of Science)); 23IMB-I-1F (State Committee of Science (Armenian State Committee of Science)); 22IMB-I-1F (State Committee of Science (Armenian State Committee of Science)); 23IMB-I-1F (State Committee of Science (Armenian State Committee of Science)); 22IMB-I-1F (State Committee of Science (Armenian State Committee of Science)); 23IMB-I-1F (State Committee of Science (Armenian State Committee of Science)),Journal Article

38367035,Role of zinc in health and disease.,"This review provides a concise overview of the cellular and clinical aspects of the role of zinc, an essential micronutrient, in human physiology and discusses zinc-related pathological states. Zinc cannot be stored in significant amounts, so regular dietary intake is essential. ZIP4 and/or ZnT5B transport dietary zinc ions from the duodenum into the enterocyte, ZnT1 transports zinc ions from the enterocyte into the circulation, and ZnT5B (bidirectional zinc transporter) facilitates endogenous zinc secretion into the intestinal lumen. Putative promoters of zinc absorption that increase its bioavailability include amino acids released from protein digestion and citrate, whereas dietary phytates, casein and calcium can reduce zinc bioavailability. In circulation, 70% of zinc is bound to albumin, and the majority in the body is found in skeletal muscle and bone. Zinc excretion is via faeces (predominantly), urine, sweat, menstrual flow and semen. Excessive zinc intake can inhibit the absorption of copper and iron, leading to copper deficiency and anaemia, respectively. Zinc toxicity can adversely affect the lipid profile and immune system, and its treatment depends on the mode of zinc acquisition. Acquired zinc deficiency usually presents later in life alongside risk factors like malabsorption syndromes, but medications like diuretics and angiotensin-receptor blockers can also cause zinc deficiency. Inherited zinc deficiency condition acrodermatitis enteropathica, which occurs due to mutation in the SLC39A4 gene (encoding ZIP4), presents from birth. Treatment involves zinc supplementation via zinc gluconate, zinc sulphate or zinc chloride. Notably, oral zinc supplementation may decrease the absorption of drugs like ciprofloxacin, doxycycline and risedronate.","Lucy I Stiles, Kevin Ferrao, Kosha J Mehta",Clinical and experimental medicine,2024,Acrodermatitis enteropathica; ZIP; Zinc; Zinc deficiency; Zinc toxicity; ZnT,10.1007/s10238-024-01302-6,"Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, GKT School of Medical Education, King's College London, London, UK.; Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, GKT School of Medical Education, King's College London, London, UK.; Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, Centre for Education, King's College London, London, UK. kosha.mehta@kcl.ac.uk.",Humans; Copper; Zinc; Intestines; Ions; Cation Transport Proteins; Acrodermatitis,N/A,Journal Article; Review

38363364,Beyond the sine wave: unveiling climate-driven baseline mortality cycles.,"The relationship between temperature and mortality is well-established, with higher mortality rates occurring in moderate climates during winter. Studies on COVID-19 and influenza-related excess deaths often assume a sine-like wave pattern for baseline mortality. This study aims to assess the accuracy of this approximation in capturing the observed mortality pattern and explore its linkage with climate. Weekly mortality data from European regions (2000-2019) were modeled using the seasonal-trend decomposition procedure based on Loess. Cycles were grouped into clusters, and underlying trends were extracted using principal component analysis. Generalized linear models assuming a sine-like pattern were used to test predictive value. Cluster analysis divided the regional cycles approximately into continental and temperate climate regions, further subdivided into oceanic and Mediterranean. While the continental region exhibited a sine-like mortality pattern, it displayed modest deviations that compounded further south. The period of elevated winter mortality became shorter but more intense, while decreased summer mortality became more pronounced yet delayed. This study improves weekly estimations of excess mortality models by providing enhanced baselines. The deviation from the sine-like approximation mirrors the idealized outbreak pattern from epidemiological models with sharper surges and more gradual declines.

38362367,Immune modulation and possible pathological implications mediated by naturally produced immunoglobulin G idiotypes: from historical to recent experimental and clinical studies focused on atopic dermatitis.,"Since the 1950s decade, it has been suggested that a naturally produced or induced repertoire of immunoglobulin G (IgG) idiotypes may exert some immunoregulatory functions. In the last decades, some more advanced theories have suggested that the repertoire of IgG idiotypes may influence the development or control of some atopic diseases. In atopic dermatitis (AD), some evidence indicated that the IgG repertoire obtained from these patients could effectively mediate regulatory functions on thymic and peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Furthermore, some recent clinical trials have corroborated the hypothesis that IgG from AD patients can exert regulatory functions ","Lucas Santander, Nicolle Rakanidis Machado, Beatriz Oliveira Fagundes, Jefferson Russo Victor",Clinical and experimental vaccine research,2024,Anti-idiotypic antibodies; Atopic dermatitis; CD4+ T; CD8+ T; Idiotypes; Immunoglobulin G,10.7774/cevr.2024.13.1.1,"Medical School, Santo Amaro University, Sao Paulo, Brazil.; Laboratory of Medical Investigation LIM-56, Division of Dermatology, University of Sao Paulo, Medical School, Sao Paulo, Brazil.; Laboratory of Medical Investigation LIM-56, Division of Dermatology, University of Sao Paulo, Medical School, Sao Paulo, Brazil.; Laboratory of Medical Investigation LIM-56, Division of Dermatology, University of Sao Paulo, Medical School, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",N/A,N/A,Journal Article; Review

This research aimed to experimentally test the effect of communication strategies on influenza vaccine uptake intention. We hypothesized that the effect of descriptive norm level (10%-50%-90% of others vaccinated) on intention would vary according to whether the benefits are focused on the individual (self-interest motives) or others (herd-immunity motives). In particular, we predicted that low and high levels of norms would be detrimental in the herd-immunity condition (inverted-U pattern). In contrast, intention should increase linearly with the norm in the self-interest condition.","Lisa S Moussaoui, Neele H Heiser, Olivier Desrichard","Health psychology : official journal of the Division of Health Psychology, American Psychological Association",2024,N/A,10.1037/hea0001357,"Research Group in Health Psychology, Psychology and Educational Sciences Faculty, Geneva University.; Research Group in Health Psychology, Psychology and Educational Sciences Faculty, Geneva University.; Research Group in Health Psychology, Psychology and Educational Sciences Faculty, Geneva University.","Humans; Intention; Immunity, Herd; Influenza, Human; Motivation; Vaccination; Influenza Vaccines",N/A,Journal Article
38358352,Characterizing Neutrophil Subtypes in Cancer Using scRNA Sequencing Demonstrates the Importance of IL1β/CXCR2 Axis in Generation of Metastasis-specific Neutrophils.,"Neutrophils are a highly heterogeneous cellular population. However, a thorough examination of the different transcriptional neutrophil states between health and malignancy has not been performed. We utilized single-cell RNA sequencing of human and murine datasets, both publicly available and independently generated, to identify neutrophil transcriptomic subtypes and developmental lineages in health and malignancy. Datasets of lung, breast, and colorectal cancer were integrated to establish and validate neutrophil gene signatures. Pseudotime analysis was used to identify genes driving neutrophil development from health to cancer. Finally, ligand-receptor interactions and signaling pathways between neutrophils and other immune cell populations in primary colorectal cancer and metastatic colorectal cancer were investigated. We define two main neutrophil subtypes in primary tumors: an activated subtype sharing the transcriptomic signatures of healthy neutrophils; and a tumor-specific subtype. This signature is conserved in murine and human cancer, across different tumor types. In colorectal cancer metastases, neutrophils are more heterogeneous, exhibiting additional transcriptomic subtypes. Pseudotime analysis implicates IL1β/CXCL8/CXCR2 axis in the progression of neutrophils from health to cancer and metastasis, with effects on T-cell effector function. Functional analysis of neutrophil-tumoroid cocultures and T-cell proliferation assays using orthotopic metastatic mouse models lacking Cxcr2 in neutrophils support our transcriptional analysis. We propose that the emergence of metastatic-specific neutrophil subtypes is driven by the IL1β/CXCL8/CXCR2 axis, with the evolution of different transcriptomic signals that impair T-cell function at the metastatic site. Thus, a better understanding of neutrophil transcriptomic programming could optimize immunotherapeutic interventions into early and late interventions, targeting different neutrophil states.","Rana Fetit, Alistair S McLaren, Mark White, Megan L Mills, John Falconer, Xabier Cortes-Lavaud, Kathryn Gilroy, Tamsin R M Lannagan, Rachel A Ridgway, Colin Nixon, Varushka Naiker, Renee Njunge, Cassie J Clarke, Declan Whyte, Kristina Kirschner, Rene Jackstadt, Jim Norman, Leo M Carlin, Andrew D Campbell, Owen J Sansom, Colin W Steele",Cancer research communications,2024,N/A,10.1158/2767-9764.CRC-23-0319,"CRUK Scotland Institute, Glasgow, United Kingdom.; CRUK Scotland Institute, Glasgow, United Kingdom.; CRUK Scotland Institute, Glasgow, United Kingdom.; CRUK Scotland Institute, Glasgow, United Kingdom.; CRUK Scotland Institute, Glasgow, United Kingdom.; CRUK Scotland Institute, Glasgow, United Kingdom.; CRUK Scotland Institute, Glasgow, United Kingdom.; CRUK Scotland Institute, Glasgow, United Kingdom.; CRUK Scotland Institute, Glasgow, United Kingdom.; CRUK Scotland Institute, Glasgow, United Kingdom.; CRUK Scotland Institute, Glasgow, United Kingdom.; CRUK Scotland Institute, Glasgow, United Kingdom.; CRUK Scotland Institute, Glasgow, United Kingdom.; CRUK Scotland Institute, Glasgow, United Kingdom.; CRUK Scotland Institute, Glasgow, United Kingdom.; CRUK Scotland Institute, Glasgow, United Kingdom.; CRUK Scotland Institute, Glasgow, United Kingdom.; CRUK Scotland Institute, Glasgow, United Kingdom.; CRUK Scotland Institute, Glasgow, United Kingdom.; CRUK Scotland Institute, Glasgow, United Kingdom.; CRUK Scotland Institute, Glasgow, United Kingdom.","Animals; Mice; Humans; Neutrophils; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Signal Transduction; Colorectal Neoplasms; Single-Cell Analysis",PCL/17/03 (Chief Scientist Office); 23001 (Blood Cancer UK),"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"
38357571,"Mechanism of action, benefits, and research gap in fermented soybean meal utilization as a high-quality protein source for livestock and poultry.","Animal nutritionists have incessantly worked towards providing livestock with high-quality plant protein feed resources. Soybean meal (SBM) has been an essential and predominantly adopted vegetable protein source in livestock feeding for a long time; however, several SBM antinutrients could potentially impair the animal's performance and growth, limiting its use. Several processing methods have been employed to remove SBM antinutrients, including fermentation with fungal or bacterial microorganisms. According to the literature, fermentation, a traditional food processing method, could improve SBM's nutritional and functional properties, making it more suitable and beneficial to livestock. The current interest in health-promoting functional feed, which can enhance the growth of animals, improve their immune system, and promote physiological benefits more than conventional feed, coupled with the ban on the use of antimicrobial growth promoters, has caused a renewed interest in the use of fermented SBM (FSBM) in livestock diets. This review details the mechanism of SBM fermentation and its impacts on animal health and discusses the recent trend in the application and emerging advantages to livestock while shedding light on the research gap that needs to be critically addressed in future studies. FSBM appears to be a multifunctional high-quality plant protein source for animals. Besides removing soybean antinutrients, beneficial bioactive peptides and digestive enzymes are produced during fermentation, providing probiotics, antioxidants, and immunomodulatory effects. Critical aspects regarding FSBM feeding to animals remain uncharted, such as the duration of fermentation, the influence of feeding on digestive tissue development, choice of microbial strain, and possible environmental impact.","Modinat T Lambo, Haokai Ma, Haosheng Zhang, Peng Song, Hongxiang Mao, Guowen Cui, Baisheng Dai, Yang Li, Yonggen Zhang",Animal nutrition (Zhongguo xu mu shou yi xue hui),2024,Fermentation; Livestock; Microorganism; Protein feed; Soybean meal,10.1016/j.aninu.2023.10.003,"College of Animal Science and Technology, Northeast Agricultural University, Harbin 150030, China.; College of Animal Science and Technology, Northeast Agricultural University, Harbin 150030, China.; College of Animal Science and Technology, Northeast Agricultural University, Harbin 150030, China.; Wilmar (Shanghai) Biotechnology Research and Development Center Co., Ltd, Shanghai 200137, China.; Wilmar (Shanghai) Biotechnology Research and Development Center Co., Ltd, Shanghai 200137, China.; College of Animal Science and Technology, Northeast Agricultural University, Harbin 150030, China.; College of Electrical Engineering and Information, Northeast Agricultural University, Harbin 150030, China.; College of Animal Science and Technology, Northeast Agricultural University, Harbin 150030, China.; College of Animal Science and Technology, Northeast Agricultural University, Harbin 150030, China.",N/A,N/A,Journal Article; Review
38355819,"Intertwined regulators: hypoxia pathway proteins, microRNAs, and phosphodiesterases in the control of steroidogenesis.","Oxygen sensing is of paramount importance for maintaining cellular and systemic homeostasis. In response to diminished oxygen levels, the hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) orchestrate various biological processes. These pivotal transcription factors have been identified as key regulators of several biological events. Notably, extensive research from our group and others has demonstrated that HIF1α exerts an inverse regulatory effect on steroidogenesis, leading to the suppression of crucial steroidogenic enzyme expression and a subsequent decrease in steroid levels. These steroid hormones occupy pivotal roles in governing a myriad of physiological processes. Substantial or prolonged fluctuations in steroid levels carry detrimental consequences across multiple organ systems and underlie various pathological conditions, including metabolic and immune disorders. MicroRNAs serve as potent mediators of multifaceted gene regulatory mechanisms, acting as influential epigenetic regulators that modulate a broad spectrum of gene expressions. Concomitantly, phosphodiesterases (PDEs) play a crucial role in governing signal transduction. PDEs meticulously manage intracellular levels of both cAMP and cGMP, along with their respective signaling pathways and downstream targets. Intriguingly, an intricate interplay seems to exist between hypoxia signaling, microRNAs, and PDEs in the regulation of steroidogenesis. This review highlights recent advances in our understanding of the role of microRNAs during hypoxia-driven processes, including steroidogenesis, as well as the possibilities that exist in the application of HIF prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) inhibitors for the modulation of steroidogenesis.","Stephen Ariyeloye, Susanne Kämmerer, Erik Klapproth, Ben Wielockx, Ali El-Armouche",Pflugers Archiv : European journal of physiology,2024,Hypoxia; MicroRNA; Phosphodiesterases; Regulation; Steroidogenesis,10.1007/s00424-024-02921-4,"Institute of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine, Medical Faculty, Technische Universität Dresden, Fetscherstrasse 74, 01307, Dresden, Germany.; Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Medical Faculty, Technische Universität Dresden, Fetscherstrasse 74, 01307, Dresden, Germany.; Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Medical Faculty, Technische Universität Dresden, Fetscherstrasse 74, 01307, Dresden, Germany.; Institute of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine, Medical Faculty, Technische Universität Dresden, Fetscherstrasse 74, 01307, Dresden, Germany.

38353655,Sensing Dying Cells in Health and Disease: The Importance of Kidney Injury Molecule-1.,"Kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), also known as T-cell Ig and mucin domain-1 (TIM-1), is a widely recognized biomarker for AKI, but its biological function is less appreciated. KIM-1/TIM-1 belongs to the T-cell Ig and mucin domain family of conserved transmembrane proteins, which bear the characteristic six-cysteine Ig-like variable domain. The latter enables binding of KIM-1/TIM-1 to its natural ligand, phosphatidylserine, expressed on the surface of apoptotic cells and necrotic cells. KIM-1/TIM-1 is expressed in a variety of tissues and plays fundamental roles in regulating sterile inflammation and adaptive immune responses. In the kidney, KIM-1 is upregulated on injured renal proximal tubule cells, which transforms them into phagocytes for clearance of dying cells and helps to dampen sterile inflammation. TIM-1, expressed in T cells, B cells, and natural killer T cells, is essential for cell activation and immune regulatory functions in the host. Functional polymorphisms in the gene for KIM-1/TIM-1, HAVCR1 , have been associated with susceptibility to immunoinflammatory conditions and hepatitis A virus-induced liver failure, which is thought to be due to a differential ability of KIM-1/TIM-1 variants to bind phosphatidylserine. This review will summarize the role of KIM-1/TIM-1 in health and disease and its potential clinical applications as a biomarker and therapeutic target in humans.","Elena Tutunea-Fatan, Shabitha Arumugarajah, Rita S Suri, Cassandra R Edgar, Ingrid Hon, Jimmy D Dikeakos, Lakshman Gunaratnam",Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,2024,N/A,10.1681/ASN.0000000000000334,"Matthew Mailing Centre for Translational Transplant Studies, Lawson Health Research Institute, London Health Sciences Centre, London, Ontario, Canada.; Matthew Mailing Centre for Translational Transplant Studies, Lawson Health Research Institute, London Health Sciences Centre, London, Ontario, Canada.; Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, Western University, London, Ontario, Canada.; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, Western University, London, Ontario, Canada.; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, Western University, London, Ontario, Canada.; Matthew Mailing Centre for Translational Transplant Studies, Lawson Health Research Institute, London Health Sciences Centre, London, Ontario, Canada.",Humans; Hepatitis A Virus Cellular Receptor 1; Acute Kidney Injury; Apoptosis; Animals; Biomarkers,"486695 (Institute of Nutrition, Metabolism and Diabetes); KHRG-919951 (Kidney Foundation of Canada)",Journal Article; Review

Understanding the role of COVID-19 related stress, conspiracy theories, health literacy, racial discrimination experiences, and confidence in health authorities can inform programs to increase vaccination coverage. We sought to analyze these factors and vaccine uptake among Black individuals in Canada. A representative sample of 2002 Black individuals from Ontario, Quebec, Alberta, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, British Columbia, and Manitoba, aged 14 years or older completed questionnaires assessing vaccine uptake, health literacy, conspiracy theories, racial discrimination experiences, COVID-19-related stress, and confidence in health authorities. Mediation analyses were conducted to assess (1) the effect of health literacy on COVID-19 vaccination uptake through confidence and need, COVID-19 related traumatic stress, and racial discrimination, and (2) the effect of conspiracy beliefs on COVID-19 vaccination uptake through the same factors. Overall, 69.57% (95% confidence interval, 67.55%-71.59%) of the participants were vaccinated and 83.48% of them received two or more doses. Those aged 55 years and older were less likely to be vaccinated, as well as those residing in British Columbia and Manitoba.

38344273,Unraveling the complex relationship between mRNA and protein abundances: a machine learning-based approach for imputing protein levels from RNA-seq data.,"The correlation between messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein abundances has long been debated. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), a high-throughput, commonly used method for analyzing transcriptional dynamics, leaves questions about whether we can translate RNA-seq-identified gene signatures directly to protein changes. In this study, we utilized a set of 17 widely assessed immune and wound healing mediators in the context of canine volumetric muscle loss to investigate the correlation of mRNA and protein abundances. Our data reveal an overall agreement between mRNA and protein levels on these 17 mediators when examining samples from the same experimental condition (e.g. the same biopsy). However, we observed a lack of correlation between mRNA and protein levels for individual genes under different conditions, underscoring the challenges in converting transcriptional changes into protein changes. To address this discrepancy, we developed a machine learning model to predict protein abundances from RNA-seq data, achieving high accuracy. Our approach also effectively corrected multiple extreme outliers measured by antibody-based protein assays. Additionally, this model has the potential to detect post-translational modification events, as shown by accurately estimating activated transforming growth factor β1 levels. This study presents a promising approach for converting RNA-seq data into protein abundance and its biological significance.","Archana Prabahar, Ruben Zamora, Derek Barclay, Jinling Yin, Mahesh Ramamoorthy, Atefeh Bagheri, Scott A Johnson, Stephen Badylak, Yoram Vodovotz, Peng Jiang",NAR genomics and bioinformatics,2024,N/A,10.1093/nargab/lqae019,"Center for Gene Regulation in Health and Disease, Cleveland State University, Cleveland, OH 44115, USA.; McGowan Institute for Regenerative Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15219, USA.; McGowan Institute for Regenerative Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15219, USA.; McGowan Institute for Regenerative Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15219, USA.; Center for Gene Regulation in Health and Disease, Cleveland State University, Cleveland, OH 44115, USA.; Center for Gene Regulation in Health and Disease, Cleveland State University, Cleveland, OH 44115, USA.; McGowan Institute for Regenerative Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15219, USA.; McGowan Institute for Regenerative Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15219, USA.; McGowan Institute for Regenerative Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15219, USA.; Center for Gene Regulation in Health and Disease, Cleveland State University, Cleveland, OH 44115, USA.",N/A,N/A,Journal Article

Recent evidence suggests that the gut-brain immune axis is an attractive theragnostic target due to its innate capacity to excite the immune system by activating monocyte exosomes. These exosomes induce spontaneous alterations in the microRNAs within the brain endothelial cells, resulting in an acute inflammatory response with physiological and psychological sequelae, evidenced by anxiety and depression. Exploring the role of the stress models that influence anxiety and depression may reflect on the effect and role of exosomes, shedding light on various physiological responses that explain the contributing factors of cardiovascular disorders. The pathophysiological effects of gut-microbiome dysbiosis are further accentuated by alterations in the glucose metabolism, leading to type 2 diabetes, which is known to be a risk factor for cardiovascular disorders. Understanding the role of exosomes and their implications for cell-to-cell communication, inflammatory responses, and neuronal stress reactions can easily provide insight into the gut-brain immune axis and downstream cardiovascular sequelae.","Emilda Judith Ezhil Rajan, Sai Varsaa Alwar, Richa Gulati, Rohan Rajiv, Tridip Mitra, Rajiv Janardhanan",Frontiers in molecular biosciences,2023,cardiovascular diseases (CVD); depression; diabetes; exosomal microRNA; gut-brain immune axis,10.3389/fmolb.2023.1330327,"Department of Clinical Psychology, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Kattankulathur, India.; Researcher, Division of Medical Research, Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences, SRM IST, Kattankulathur, India.; Researcher, Division of Medical Research, Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences, SRM IST, Kattankulathur, India.; Dietrich School of Arts and Sciences, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PaA, United States.; Division of Medical Research, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Kattankulathur, India.; Division of Medical Research, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Kattankulathur, India.",N/A,N/A,Journal Article; Review

They are not informing on whether public mental health has adapted to the pandemic. The aim of this analysis was to 1) investigate trajectories of monthly reported depressive symptoms from July 2020 to December 2021 in Switzerland, 2) compare average growth trajectories across regions with different stringency phases, and 3) explore the relative impact of self-reported worries related to health, economic and social domains as well as socio-economic indicators on growth trajectories. As part of the population-based Corona Immunitas program of regional, but harmonized, adult cohorts studying the pandemic course and impact, participants repeatedly reported online to the DASS-21 instrument on depressive symptomatology. Trajectories of depressive symptoms were estimated using a latent growth model, specified as a generalised linear mixed model. The time effect was modelled parametrically through a polynomial allowing to estimate trajectories for participants' missing time points. In all regions level and shape of the trajectories mirrored those of the KOF Stringency-Plus Index, which quantifies regional Covid-19 policy stringency. The higher level of average depression in trajectories of those expressing specific worries was most noticeable for the social domain. Younger age, female gender, and low household income went along with higher mean depression score trajectories throughout follow-up.

38317142,"The dynamic shifts of IL-10-producing Th17 and IL-17-producing Treg in health and disease: a crosstalk between ancient ""Yin-Yang"" theory and modern immunology.","The changes in T regulatory cell (Treg) and T helper cell (Th) 17 ratios holds paramount importance in ensuring internal homeostasis and disease progression. Recently, novel subsets of Treg and Th17, namely IL-17-producing Treg and IL-10-producing Th17 have been identified. IL-17-producing Treg and IL-10-producing Th17 are widely considered as the intermediates during Treg/Th17 transformation. These ""bi-functional"" cells exhibit plasticity and have been demonstrated with important roles in multiple physiological functions and disease processes. Yin and Yang represent opposing aspects of phenomena according to the ancient Chinese philosophy ""Yin-Yang"" theory. Furthermore, Yin can transform into Yang, and vice versa, under specific conditions. This theory has been widely used to describe the contrasting functions of immune cells and molecules. Therefore, immune-activating populations (Th17, M1 macrophage, etc.) and immune overreaction (inflammation, autoimmunity) can be considered Yang, while immunosuppressive populations (Treg, M2 macrophage, etc.) and immunosuppression (tumor, immunodeficiency) can be considered Yin. However, another important connotation of ""Yin-Yang"" theory, the conversion between Yin and Yang, has been rarely documented in immune studies. The discovery of IL-17-producing Treg and IL-10-producing Th17 enriches the meaning of ""Yin-Yang"" theory and further promotes the relationship between ancient ""Yin-Yang"" theory and modern immunology. Besides, illustrating the functions of IL-17-producing Treg and IL-10-producing Th17 and mechanisms governing their differentiation provides valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying the dynamically changing statement of immune statement in health and diseases.","Huantian Cui, Ning Wang, Hanzhou Li, Yuhong Bian, Weibo Wen, Xiangying Kong, Fudi Wang",Cell communication and signaling : CCS,2024,Disease progression; IL-10-producing Th17; IL-17-producing Treg; Immune system; Yin-Yang theory,10.1186/s12964-024-01505-0,"First School of Clinical Medicine, Yunnan University of Chinese Medicine, Kunming, 650500, China.; First School of Clinical Medicine, Yunnan University of Chinese Medicine, Kunming, 650500, China.; College of Integrative Chinese and Western Medicine, Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin, 301617, China.; College of Integrative Chinese and Western Medicine, Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin, 301617, China. bianyuhong_2012@163.com.; First School of Clinical Medicine, Yunnan University of Chinese Medicine, Kunming, 650500, China. wenweibo2020@163.com.; Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, 100700, China. xykong@icmm.ac.cn.; The First Affiliated Hospital, Institute of Translational Medicine, The Second Affiliated Hospital, School of Public Health, Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, 310058, China. fwang@zju.edu.cn.","Humans; T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory; Interleukin-17; Interleukin-10; Th17 Cells; Inflammation",82374562 (National Natural Science Foundation of China),"Journal Article; Review; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"
38313093,Health Belief Model in studies of influenza vaccination among health care workers.,"Vaccines prevent numerous infectious diseases, including influenza. Despite their significant contribution to controlling influenza, vaccine coverage against this disease varies among health care workers. The Health Belief Model could thus help to understand the reasons why these workers accept (or not) the immunobiological. The aim of this study was to describe the main results of research performed on influenza vaccination among health care workers using the Health Belief Model. This is an integrative literature review. Data search took place in October 2020 in the PubMed database, with the following descriptors: ""influenza vaccine""; ""health professionals""; ""Health Belief Model,"" and their synonyms. Eleven studies were included in this review. The main dimensions of the model (susceptibility, severity, benefits, and barriers) were more explored by the studies, and self-efficacy was the least studied dimension. Moreover, we observed a relationship between the theory's dimensions (susceptibility, severity, benefits, barriers, cues to action, and self-efficacy) and influenza vaccination in health care workers. In conclusion, this review identified profiles of beliefs for each dimension of the Health Belief Model, which has traditionally been an ally for determining refusal or acceptance of the influenza vaccine among health care workers.","Suellen Bittencourt Silva, Fernanda de Oliveira Souza, Paloma de Sousa Pinho, Deisy Vital Santos",Revista brasileira de medicina do trabalho : publicacao oficial da Associacao Nacional de Medicina do Trabalho-ANAMT,2023,health belief model; health personnel; influenza vaccines,10.47626/1679-4435-2022-839,"Centro de Ciências da Saúde, Universidade Federal do Recôncavo da Bahia, Santo Antônio de Jesus, BA, Brazil.; Centro de Ciências da Saúde, Universidade Federal do Recôncavo da Bahia, Santo Antônio de Jesus, BA, Brazil.; Centro de Ciências da Saúde, Universidade Federal do Recôncavo da Bahia, Santo Antônio de Jesus, BA, Brazil.; Centro de Ciências da Saúde, Universidade Federal do Recôncavo da Bahia, Santo Antônio de Jesus, BA, Brazil.",N/A,N/A,Journal Article; Review

The school selected 27 PhD students and 13 postdoctoral fellows from 20 countries and involved 14 faculty members experts in the field. The Winter School focused on a rising field of research, the interactions between the nervous and both innate and adaptive immune systems under pathological and physiological conditions. A fine-tuned neuro-immune crosstalk is fundamental for healthy development, while disrupted neuro-immune communication might play a role in neurodegeneration, neuroinflammation and aging. However, much is yet to be understood about the underlying mechanisms of these neuro-immune interactions in the healthy brain and under pathological scenarios. In addition to new findings in this emerging field, novel methodologies and animal models were presented to foment research on neuro-immunology. The FENS-Hertie 2022 Winter School provided an insightful knowledge exchange between students and faculty focusing on the latest discoveries in the biology of neuro-immune interactions while fostering great academic and professional opportunities for early-career neuroscientists from around the world.","Luisa B Binder, Priscila B Rosa, Bárbara M de Sousa, Luana S Chagas, Olga Dubljević, Fanny Sandrine Martineau, Francesca Mottarlini, Sílvia Castany, Lorena Morton, Fran Krstanović, Isadora D Tassinari, Jeiny L Choconta, Ana Raquel Pereira-Santos, Laetitia Weinhard, Praveen N Pallegar, Björn F Vahsen, Izabela Lepiarz-Raba, Anne-Claire Compagnion, Marina Lorente-Picón",The European journal of neuroscience,2024,microglia; neurodevelopment and neurodegeneration; neuro‐immune interactions,10.1111/ejn.16262,"Department of Psychiatry and Neuroscience, Faculty of Medicine and CERVO Brain Research Center, Université Laval, Quebec City, Canada.; Center for Social and Affective Neuroscience (CSAN), Linköping University, Linköping, Sweden.; Institute of Biomedicine (iBiMED), Department of Medical Sciences, Universidade de Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal.; Department of Neurobiology, Institute of Biology, Fluminense Federal University, Niterói, Brazil.; Department of Neurobiology, Univerzitet u Beogradu Institut za Biološka Istraživanja Siniša Stanković, Institute for Biological Research, Beograd, Republic of Serbia.; Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.; Department of Pharmacological and Biomolecular Sciences 'Rodolfo Paoletti', Università degli Studi di Milano, Milan, Italy.; Center for Social and Affective Neuroscience (CSAN), Linköping University, Linköping, Sweden.; Faculty of Medicine, Institute of Inflammation and Neurodegeneration, Otto-von-Guericke University, Magdeburg, Germany.; Faculty of Medicine, Center for Proteomics, University of Rijeka, Rijeka, Croatia.; Department of Physiology, Graduate Program in Physiology, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil.; Institute of Physiology, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.; Center for Neuroscience and Cell Biology (CNC), CIBB - Center for Innovative Biomedicine and Biotechnology, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal.; NYU Grossman School of Medicine, New York, New York, USA.; Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.; Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Oxford Motor Neuron Disease Centre, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK.; BRAINCITY: Centre of Excellence for Neural Plasticity and Brain Disorders, Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology PAS, Warsaw, Poland.; Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.; Vall d'Hebron Research Institute (VHIR), Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (UAB), Barcelona, Spain.",Animals; Humans; Neuroimmunomodulation; Neurosciences; Brain; Schools; Aging,N/A,Editorial
38310657,The Sjögren's Working Group: The 2023 OMERACT meeting and provisional domain generation.,"Sjögren's disease (SjD) is a systemic autoimmune exocrinopathy with key features of dryness, pain, and fatigue. SjD can affect any organ system with a variety of presentations across individuals. This heterogeneity is one of the major barriers for developing effective disease modifying treatments. Defining core disease domains comprising both specific clinical features and incorporating the patient experience is a critical first step to define this complex disease. The OMERACT SjD Working Group held its first international collaborative hybrid meeting in 2023, applying the OMERACT 2.2 filter toward identification of core domains. We accomplished our first goal, a scoping literature review that was presented at the Special Interest Group held in May 2023. Building on the domains identified in the scoping review, we uniquely deployed multidisciplinary experts as part of our collaborative team to generate a provisional domain list that captures SjD heterogeneity.","Rachael A Gordon, Yann Nguyen, Nathan Foulquier, Maxime Beydon, Tamer A Gheita, Raouf Hajji, Ilfita Sahbudin, Alberta Hoi, Wan-Fai Ng, Jose Alexandre Mendonça, Daniel J Wallace, Beverley Shea, George Aw Bruyn, Susan M Goodman, Benjamin A Fisher, Chiara Baldini, Karina D Torralba, Hendrika Bootsma, Esen K Akpek, Sezen Karakus, Alan N Baer, Soumya D Chakravarty, Lene Terslev, Maria-Antonietta D'Agostino, Xavier Mariette, Dana DiRenzo, Astrid Rasmussen, Athena Papas, Cristina Montoya, Suzanne Arends, Md Yuzaiful Md Yusof, Ionut Pintilie, Blake M Warner, Katherine M Hammitt, Vibeke Strand, Coralie Bouillot, Peter Tugwell, Nevsun Inanc, José Luis Andreu, Marie Wahren-Herlenius, Valerie Devauchelle-Pensec, Caroline H Shiboski, Anas Benyoussef, Sharmila Masli, Adrian Y S Lee, Divi Cornec, Simon Bowman, Maureen Rischmueller, Sara S McCoy, Raphaele Seror",Seminars in arthritis and rheumatism,2024,Artificial intelligence;

38310524,Mesenchymal Stromal/Stem Cells Know Best: The Remarkable Complexities of Its Interactions With Polymorphonuclear Neutrophils.,"Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs), the predominant immune cell type in humans, have long been known as first-line effector cells against bacterial infections mainly through phagocytosis and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, recent research has unveiled novel and pivotal roles of these abundant but short-lived granulocytes in health and disease. Human mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs), renowned for their regenerative properties and modulation of T lymphocytes from effector to regulatory phenotypes, exhibit complex and context-dependent interactions with PMNs. Regardless of species or source, MSCs strongly abrogate PMN apoptosis, a critical determinant of PMN function, except if PMNs are highly stimulated. MSCs also have the capacity to fine-tune PMN activation, particularly in terms of CD11b expression and phagocytosis. Moreover, MSCs can modulate numerous other PMN functions, spanning migration, ROS production, and neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation/NETosis, but directionality is remarkably dependent on the underlying context: in normal nondiseased conditions, MSCs enhance PMN migration and ROS production, whereas in inflammatory conditions, MSCs reduce both these functions and NETosis. Furthermore, the state of the MSCs themselves, whether isolated from diseased or healthy donors, and the specific secreted products and molecules, can impact interactions with PMNs; while healthy MSCs prevent PMN infiltration and NETosis, MSCs isolated from patients with cancer promote these functions. This comprehensive analysis highlights the intricate interplay between PMNs and MSCs and its profound relevance in healthy and pathological conditions, shedding light on how to best strategize the use of MSCs in the expanding list of diseases with PMN involvement.","Li-Tzu Wang, Wei Lee, Ko-Jiunn Liu, Huey-Kang Sytwu, Men-Luh Yen, B Linju Yen","Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",2024,CD11b; NETosis; apoptosis; mesenchymal stromal/stem cells; migration; phagocytosis; polymorphonuclear neutrophils; reactive oxygen species,10.1093/stmcls/sxae011,"Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, National Taiwan University (NTU) Hospital and College of Medicine, NTU, Taipei, Taiwan.; Regenerative Medicine Research Group, Institute of Cellular and System Medicine, National Health Research Institutes (NHRI), Zhunan, Taiwan.; National Institute of Cancer Research, NHRI, Tainan, Taiwan.; National Institute of Infectious Diseases and Vaccinology, NHRI, Zhunan, Taiwan.; Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, National Taiwan University (NTU) Hospital and College of Medicine, NTU, Taipei, Taiwan.; Regenerative Medicine Research Group, Institute of Cellular and System Medicine, National Health Research Institutes (NHRI), Zhunan, Taiwan.",Humans; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Neutrophils; Reactive Oxygen Species; Animals; Phagocytosis,MOST111-2314-B-002-159-MY3 (Taiwan National Science and Technology Council); TMU112-AE1-B08 (Taipei Medical University),Journal Article; Review
38301927,A multivalent CD44 glycoconjugate vaccine candidate for cancer immunotherapy.,"Cancer presents a high mortality rate due to ineffective treatments and tumour relapse with progression. Cancer vaccines hold tremendous potential due to their capability to eradicate tumour and prevent relapse. In this study, we present a novel glycovaccine for precise targeting and immunotherapy of aggressive solid tumours that overexpress CD44 standard isoform (CD44s) carrying immature Tn and sialyl-Tn (sTn) O-glycans. We describe an enzymatic method and an enrichment strategy to generate libraries of well-characterized cancer-specific CD44s-Tn and/or sTn glycoproteoforms, which mimic the heterogeneity found in tumours. We conjugated CD44-Tn-derived glycopeptides with carrier proteins making them more immunogenic, with further demonstration of the importance of this conjugation to overcome the glycopeptides' intrinsic toxicity. We have optimized the glycopeptide-protein maleimide-thiol conjugation chemistry to avoid undesirable cross-linking between carrier proteins and CD44s glycopeptides. The resulting glycovaccines candidates were well-tolerated in vivo, inducing both humoral and cellular immunity, including immunological memory. The generated antibodies exhibited specific reactivity against synthetic CD44s-Tn glycopeptides, CD44s-Tn glycoengineered cells, and human tumours. In summary, we present a promising prototype of a cancer glycovaccine for future therapeutical pre-clinical efficacy validation.","Rui Freitas, Andreia Miranda, Dylan Ferreira, Marta Relvas-Santos, Flávia Castro, Eduardo Ferreira, Cristiana Gaiteiro, Janine Soares, Sofia Cotton, Martina Gonçalves, Mariana Eiras, Beatriz Santos, Carlos Palmeira, Margareta P Correia, Maria José Oliveira, Bruno Sarmento, Andreia Peixoto, Lúcio Lara Santos, André M N Silva, José Alexandre Ferreira",Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,2024,CD44;

38588356,Adverse jaw outcomes from immune checkpoint inhibitors for head-and-neck cancer? Case reports.,"Radiation treatment plays a mainstream role in the management of head and neck cancers (HNSCC). Adverse effects from radiation therapy include osteoradionecrosis of the jaw, and rarely, pathological fracture. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) such as pembrolizumab are of growing relevance to the management of metastatic and recurrent HNSCC. Adverse impact on bone secondary to medications such as pembrolizumab and nivolumab have been sporadically documented in the literature. The objective of this manuscript is to raise awareness of possible increase in risk for adverse jaw outcomes in patients with HNSCC exposed to both radiation treatment to the jaws and ICI therapy. This manuscript documents adverse jaw outcomes including osteonecrosis and pathological fracture of the mandible in two patients receiving pembrolizumab for management of HNSCC and had received prior radiation treatment. A potential link between immunotherapy and adverse jaw outcomes is consistent with our growing understanding of osteoimmunology, investigating the closely interrelated processes in bone remodeling and immune system function, in health and disease. It is important to ascertain if pembrolizumab poses an incremental risk for such outcomes, beyond the risk from prior radiation, for patients managed with radiation treatment and ICI therapy for HNSCC. The general dentist may encounter such patients either in the context of facilitating dental clearance prior to initiation of chemotherapy, or rarely, with poorly explained jaw symptoms and must be alert to the possibility of occurrence of such adverse jaw events to facilitate timely diagnosis and optimal patient management.","Gayathri Subramanian, Vincent Yeung, Soly Baredes, Sung Kim, Tessa Bergsbaken, Samuel Y P Quek","Quintessence international (Berlin, Germany : 1985)",2024,Cancer; Case-report/series; Oral surgery; Osteonecrosis; Pathology; Radiation Therapy; immunotherapy,10.3290/j.qi.b4925761,N/A,N/A,N/A,Journal Article
38299599,nf-core/airrflow: an adaptive immune receptor repertoire analysis workflow employing the Immcantation framework.,"Adaptive Immune Receptor Repertoire sequencing (AIRR-seq) is a valuable experimental tool to study the immune state in health and following immune challenges such as infectious diseases, (auto)immune diseases, and cancer. Several tools have been developed to reconstruct B cell and T cell receptor sequences from AIRR-seq data and infer B and T cell clonal relationships. However, currently available tools offer limited parallelization across samples, scalability or portability to high-performance computing infrastructures. To address this need, we developed nf-core/airrflow, an end-to-end bulk and single-cell AIRR-seq processing workflow which integrates the Immcantation Framework following BCR and TCR sequencing data analysis best practices. The Immcantation Framework is a comprehensive toolset, which allows the processing of bulk and single-cell AIRR-seq data from raw read processing to clonal inference. nf-core/airrflow is written in Nextflow and is part of the nf-core project, which collects community contributed and curated Nextflow workflows for a wide variety of analysis tasks. We assessed the performance of nf-core/airrflow on simulated sequencing data with sequencing errors and show example results with real datasets. To demonstrate the applicability of nf-core/airrflow to the high-throughput processing of large AIRR-seq datasets, we validated and extended previously reported findings of convergent antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 by analyzing 97 COVID-19 infected individuals and 99 healthy controls, including a mixture of bulk and single-cell sequencing datasets. Using this dataset, we extended the convergence findings to 20 additional subjects, highlighting the applicability of nf-core/airrflow to validate findings in small in-house cohorts with reanalysis of large publicly available AIRR datasets. nf-core/airrflow is available free of charge, under the MIT license on GitHub (https://github.com/nf-core/airrflow).

38293151,Gut-Brain Axis Impact on Canine Anxiety Disorders: New Challenges for Behavioral Veterinary Medicine.,"Anxiety disorders in dogs are ever-growing and represent an important concern in the veterinary behavior field. These disorders are often disregarded in veterinary clinical practice, negatively impacting the animal's and owner's quality of life. Moreover, these anxiety disorders can potentially result in the abandonment or euthanasia of dogs. Growing evidence shows that the gut microbiota is a central player in the gut-brain axis. A variety of microorganisms inhabit the intestines of dogs, which are essential in maintaining intestinal homeostasis. These microbes can impact mental health through several mechanisms, including metabolic, neural, endocrine, and immune-mediated pathways. The disruption of a balanced composition of resident commensal communities, or dysbiosis, is implicated in several pathological conditions, including mental disorders such as anxiety. Studies carried out in rodent models and humans demonstrate that the intestinal microbiota can influence mental health through these mechanisms, including anxiety disorders. Furthermore, novel therapeutic strategies using prebiotics and probiotics have been shown to ameliorate anxiety-related symptoms. However, regarding the canine veterinary behavior field, there is still a lack of insightful research on this topic. In this review, we explore the few but relevant studies performed on canine anxiety disorders. We agree that innovative bacterial therapeutical approaches for canine anxiety disorders will become a promising field of investigation and certainly pave the way for new approaches to these behavioral conditions.","Carina Sacoor, John D Marugg, Nuno R Lima, Nuno Empadinhas, Liliana Montezinho",Veterinary medicine international,2024,N/A,10.1155/2024/2856759,"Vasco da Gama Research Center (CIVG), Vasco da Gama University School (EUVG), 3020-210 Coimbra, Portugal.; Center for Neuroscience and Cell Biology (CNC), University of Coimbra, 3004-504 Coimbra, Portugal.; Department of Veterinary Sciences, School of Agrarian and Veterinary Sciences (ECAV), University of Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro (UTAD), 5000-801 Vila Real, Portugal.; Center for Neuroscience and Cell Biology (CNC), University of Coimbra, 3004-504 Coimbra, Portugal.; Vasco da Gama Research Center (CIVG), Vasco da Gama University School (EUVG), 3020-210 Coimbra, Portugal.",N/A,N/A,Journal Article; Review

38283365,Mechanisms and functions of SUMOylation in health and disease: a review focusing on immune cells.,"SUMOylation, which is a type of post-translational modification that involves covalent conjugation of small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) proteins to target substrates, regulates various important molecular and cellular processes, including transcription, the cell cycle, cell signaling, and DNA synthesis and repair. Newly synthesized SUMO is immature and cleaved by the SUMO-specific protease family, resulting in exposure of the C-terminal Gly-Gly motif to become the mature form. In the presence of ATP, mature SUMO is conjugated with the activating enzyme E1 through the cysteine residue of E1, followed by transfer to the cysteine residue of E2-conjugating enzyme Ubc9 in humans that recognizes and modifies the lysine residue of a substrate protein. E3 SUMO ligases promote SUMOylation. SUMOylation is a reversible modification and mediated by SUMO-specific proteases. Cumulative studies have indicated that SUMOylation affects the functions of protein substrates in various manners, including cellular localization and protein stability. Gene knockout studies in mice have revealed that several SUMO cycling machinery proteins are crucial for the development and differentiation of various cell lineages, including immune cells. Aberrant SUMOylation has been implicated in several types of diseases, including cancers, cardiovascular diseases, and autoimmune diseases. This review summarizes the biochemistry of SUMO modification and the general biological functions of proteins involved in SUMOylation. In particular, this review focuses on the molecular mechanisms by which SUMOylation regulates the development, maturation, and functions of immune cells, including T, B, dendritic, and myeloid cells. This review also discusses the underlying relevance of disruption of SUMO cycling and site-specific interruption of SUMOylation on target proteins in immune cells in diseases, including cancers and infectious diseases.","Chien-Hsin Huang, Tsan-Tzu Yang, Kuo-I Lin",Journal of biomedical science,2024,Immune cells; SENPs; SUMOylation; Ubc9,10.1186/s12929-024-01003-y,"Genomics Research Center, Academia Sinica, 128 Academia Road, Sec. 2, Nankang District, Taipei, 115, Taiwan.; Genomics Research Center, Academia Sinica, 128 Academia Road, Sec. 2, Nankang District, Taipei, 115, Taiwan.; Genomics Research Center, Academia Sinica, 128 Academia Road, Sec. 2, Nankang District, Taipei, 115, Taiwan. kuoilin@gate.sinica.edu.tw.",Humans; Animals; Mice; Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes; Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins; Sumoylation; Cysteine; Ubiquitins; Ubiquitin; Neoplasms,112-2320-B001-026-MY3 (National Science and Technology Council); NHRI-EX108-10835SI (National Health Research Institutes); AS-VTA-112-01 (Academia Sinica),Journal Article; Review
38280996,Revolutionizing immune research with organoid-based co-culture and chip systems.,"The intertwined interactions various immune cells have with epithelial cells in our body require sophisticated experimental approaches to be studied. Due to the limitations of immortalized cell lines and animal models, there is an increasing demand for human in vitro model systems to investigate the microenvironment of immune cells in normal and in pathological conditions. Organoids, which are self-renewing, 3D cellular structures that are derived from stem cells, have started to provide gap-filling tissue modelling solutions. In this review, we first demonstrate with some of the available examples how organoid-based immune cell co-culture experiments can advance disease modelling of cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, and tissue regeneration. Then, we argue that to achieve both complexity and scale, organ-on-chip models combined with cutting-edge microfluidics-based technologies can provide more precise manipulation and readouts. Finally, we discuss how genome editing techniques and the use of patient-derived organoids and immune cells can improve disease modelling and facilitate precision medicine. To achieve maximum impact and efficiency, these efforts should be supported by novel infrastructures such as organoid biobanks, organoid facilities, as well as drug screening and host-microbe interaction testing platforms. All these together or in combination can allow researchers to shed more detailed, and often patient-specific, light on the crosstalk between immune cells and epithelial cells in health and disease.","Diana Papp, Tamas Korcsmaros, Isabelle Hautefort",Clinical and experimental immunology,2024,diseases modeling; drug screening; immune cells; organ-on-chip; organoids; personalized medicine,10.1093/cei/uxae004,"Department of Metabolism, Digestion and Reproduction, Imperial College London, London, UK.; Department of Metabolism, Digestion and Reproduction, Imperial College London, London, UK.; Department of Metabolism, Digestion and Reproduction, Imperial College London, London, UK.",Humans; Organoids; Coculture Techniques; Animals; Precision Medicine; Lab-On-A-Chip Devices; Inflammatory Bowel Diseases; Neoplasms,BB/X011054/1 (Institute Strategic Programme Food Microbiome and Health),Journal Article; Review

38279807,The Microbiota in Long COVID.,"Interest in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has progressively decreased lately, mainly due to the great effectivity of vaccines. Furthermore, no new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants able to circumvent the protection of these vaccines, while presenting high transmissibility and/or lethality, have appeared. However, long COVID has emerged as a huge threat to human health and economy globally. The human microbiota plays an important role in health and disease, participating in the modulation of innate and adaptive immune responses. Thus, multiple studies have found that the nasopharyngeal microbiota is altered in COVID-19 patients, with these changes associated with the onset and/or severity of the disease. Nevertheless, although dysbiosis has also been reported in long COVID patients, mainly in the gut, little is known about the possible involvement of the microbiota in the development of this disease. Therefore, in this work, we aim to fill this gap in the knowledge by discussing and comparing the most relevant studies that have been published in this field up to this point. Hence, we discuss that the relevance of long COVID has probably been underestimated, and that the available data suggest that the microbiota could be playing a pivotal role on the pathogenesis of the disease. Further research to elucidate the involvement of the microbiota in long COVID will be essential to explore new therapeutic strategies based on manipulation of the microbiota.","Carmen Álvarez-Santacruz, Sylwia D Tyrkalska, Sergio Candel",International journal of molecular sciences,2024,COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; dysbiosis; long COVID; microbiota,10.3390/ijms25021330,"Servicio de Otorrinolaringología, Hospital de la Vega Lorenzo Guirao, 30530 Cieza, Spain.; Departamento de Biología Celular e Histología, Facultad de Biología, Universidad de Murcia, 30100 Murcia, Spain.; Departamento de Biología Celular e Histología, Facultad de Biología, Universidad de Murcia, 30100 Murcia, Spain.",Humans; Post-Acute COVID-19 Syndrome; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; Dysbiosis; Microbiota; Vaccines,00006/COVI/20 (Fundación Séneca - Agencia de Ciencia y Tecnología de la Región de Murcia); 21118/SF/19 (Fundación Séneca - Agencia de Ciencia y Tecnología de la Región de Murcia); Juan de la Cierva-Incorporación (Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación),Journal Article; Review

38278458,Prenatal Programming of Monocyte Chemotactic Protein-1 Signaling in Autism Susceptibility.,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder that involves functional and structural defects in selective central nervous system (CNS) regions, harming the individual capability to process and respond to external stimuli, including impaired verbal and non-verbal communications. Etiological causes of ASD have not been fully clarified; however, prenatal activation of the innate immune system by external stimuli might infiltrate peripheral immune cells into the fetal CNS and activate cytokine secretion by microglia and astrocytes. For instance, genomic and postmortem histological analysis has identified proinflammatory gene signatures, microglia-related expressed genes, and neuroinflammatory markers in the brain during ASD diagnosis. Active neuroinflammation might also occur during the developmental stage, promoting the establishment of a defective brain connectome and increasing susceptibility to ASD after birth. While still under investigation, we tested the hypothesis whether the monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) signaling is prenatally programmed to favor peripheral immune cell infiltration and activate microglia into the fetal CNS, setting susceptibility to autism-like behavior. In this review, we will comprehensively provide the current understanding of the prenatal activation of MCP-1 signaling by external stimuli during the developmental stage as a new selective node to promote neuroinflammation, brain structural alterations, and behavioral defects associated to ASD diagnosis.","Alberto Camacho-Morales, Marcela Cárdenas-Tueme",Molecular neurobiology,2024,Autism; Chemokines; Microglia; Neuroinflammation; Prenatal programming,10.1007/s12035-024-03940-z,"College of Medicine, Department of Biochemistry, Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo Leon, Monterrey, NL, Mexico. acm590@hotmail.com.; Tecnologico de Monterrey, Escuela de Medicina y Ciencias de La Salud and The Institute for Obesity Research, 64710, Monterrey, Mexico.",Humans; Chemokine CCL2; Signal Transduction; Animals; Disease Susceptibility; Autistic Disorder; Female; Microglia; Pregnancy; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Brain; Fetal Development,N/A,Journal Article; Review

Mechanismly, urban particulate matter (PM) is the most widely air pollutant associated with increased asthma morbidity and airway inflammation. Current research found that vitamin D is an essential vitamin with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and other medical efficacy. Inadequate or deficient vitamin D often leads to the pathogenesis and stability of asthma. NGF exacerbates airway inflammation in asthma by promoting smooth muscle cell proliferation and inducing the Th2 immune response. Activation of the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway can exert a protective effect on the inflammatory response in bronchial asthma. However, the specific mechanism of this pathway in PM-involved asthmatic airway smooth muscle cells remains unclear.","Dandan Ge, Qihong Chen, Xiaohua Xie, Qiyuan Li, Yungang Yang",BMC pulmonary medicine,2024,Asthma; HO-1; Nerve growth factor; Particulate matters; Vitamin D,10.1186/s12890-024-02869-2,"Department of Pediatrics, Pediatric Key Laboratory of Xiamen, Institute of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University, Xiamen University, Zhenhai Road No.55, Xiamen, 361003, China.; Department of Pediatrics, Pediatric Key Laboratory of Xiamen, Institute of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University, Xiamen University, Zhenhai Road No.55, Xiamen, 361003, China.; Department of Pediatrics, Pediatric Key Laboratory of Xiamen, Institute of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University, Xiamen University, Zhenhai Road No.55, Xiamen, 361003, China.; National Institute for Data Science in Health and Medicine, School of Medicine, Xiamen University, Xiang'an South Road, Xiamen, 361102, China.; Department of Pediatrics, Pediatric Key Laboratory of Xiamen, Institute of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University, Xiamen University, Zhenhai Road No.55, Xiamen, 361003, China. xmyyg@sina.com.","Mice; Animals; Particulate Matter; NF-E2-Related Factor 2; Vitamin D; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha; Interleukin-6; Nerve Growth Factor; Asthma; Lung; Inflammation; Signal Transduction; Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Vitamins; Ovalbumin; Disease Models, Animal; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Cytokines",2020J011232 (the Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province); 2020J011232 (the Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province); 2020J011232 (the Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province); 2020J011232 (the Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province); YDZX20193502000003 (the Fundamental Research Funds for the Key Medical and Health Projects in Xiamen); YDZX20193502000003 (the Fundamental Research Funds for the Key Medical and Health Projects in Xiamen),Journal Article

Access to and utilisation of reproductive health services were already challenged in Sub-Saharan Africa with the COVID-19 pandemic further complicating the critical situation. This cross-sectional qualitative study aimed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and policy responses to it on the access to, and utilization of reproductive, maternal, child and adolescent health services in Kenya, Uganda, and Zambia. It sought to explore the perspectives of women of reproductive age (18-49), frontline health workers and government representatives, all from geographies that are under-researched in this context. Using purposive sampling, key informant and in-depth interviews were carried out with 63 participants across the three countries between November 2020 and February 2021. The study population included women of reproductive age (18-49 years), front-line health service providers, and government representatives We established that COVID-19 and the policy response to it affected access to and utilization of services in the three countries, the most affected being antenatal care, delivery, family planning, and immunization services. Women reported not accessing the health facilities for various reasons. Barriers to access and utilization of services cut across all the socioecological levels. Movement restrictions, particularly in Uganda where they were most severe, and fear of contracting COVID-19 at health facilities were the most reported barriers. Weak structures at community level and inadequate supply of commodities in health facilities exacerbated the situation. Mitigation factors were put in place at different levels. There is need to strengthen the health system, particularly the supply chain and to have services closer to the community to enhance access to and utilisation of services at all times and particularly during crises such as the Covid-19 pandemic.","Shiphrah Kuria-Ndiritu, Sarah Karanja, Brenda Mubita, Tonny Kapsandui, John Kutna, Dona Anyona, Joyce Murerwa, Laura Ferguson",PLOS global public health,2024,N/A,10.1371/journal.pgph.0002740,"Amref Health Africa, Headquarters, Nairobi, Kenya.; Kenya Medical Research Institute, Nairobi, Kenya.; Amref Health Africa in Zambia, Ndola, Zambia.; Amref Health Africa in Uganda, Kampala, Uganda.; Amref Health Africa in Kenya, Nairobi, Kenya.; Amref Health Africa, Headquarters, Nairobi, Kenya.; Amref Health Africa, Headquarters, Nairobi, Kenya.; Institute on Inequalities in Global Health, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, United States of America.",N/A,N/A,Journal Article

38270301,One carbon metabolism and its implication in health and immune functions.,"One carbon (1C) metabolism is critical for cellular viability and physiological homeostasis. Starting from its crucial involvement in purine biosynthesis to posttranslational modification of proteins, 1C metabolism contributes significantly to the development and cellular differentiation through methionine and folate cycles that are pivotal for cellular function. Genetic polymorphisms of several genes of these pathways are implicated in disease pathogenesis and drug metabolism. Metabolic products of 1C metabolism have significant roles in epigenetic modifications through DNA and histone protein methylation. Homocysteine is a product that has clinical significance in the diagnosis and prognosis of several critical illnesses, including chronic immune diseases and cancers. Regulation of the function and differentiation of immune cells, including T-cells, B-cells, macrophages, and so forth, are directly influenced by 1C metabolism and thus have direct implications in several immune disease biology. Recent research on therapeutic approaches is targeting nuclear, cytoplasmic, and mitochondrial 1C metabolism to manage and treat metabolic (i.e., type 2 diabetes), neurodegenerative (i.e., Alzheimer's disease), or immune (i.e., rheumatoid arthritis) diseases. 1C metabolism is being explored for therapeutic intervention as a common determinant for a spectrum of immune and metabolic diseases. Identifying the association or correlation between essential metabolic products of this pathway and disease onset or prognosis would further facilitate the clinical monitoring of diseases.","Shreya Dang, Arushi Jain, Garima Dhanda, Neetu Bhattacharya, Amit Bhattacharya, Sabyasachi Senapati",Cell biochemistry and function,2024,chronic disease; folic acid metabolism; immune function; metabolic diseases; one carbon metabolism; purine biosynthesis,10.1002/cbf.3926,"Immunogenomics Laboratory, Department of Human Genetics and Molecular Medicine, School of Health Sciences, Central University of Punjab, Bathinda, Punjab, India.; Immunogenomics Laboratory, Department of Human Genetics and Molecular Medicine, School of Health Sciences, Central University of Punjab, Bathinda, Punjab, India.; Immunogenomics Laboratory, Department of Human Genetics and Molecular Medicine, School of Health Sciences, Central University of Punjab, Bathinda, Punjab, India.; Department of Zoology, Dyal Singh College, University of Delhi, Delhi, India.; Department of Zoology, Ramjas College, University of Delhi, Delhi, India.; Immunogenomics Laboratory, Department of Human Genetics and Molecular Medicine, School of Health Sciences, Central University of Punjab, Bathinda, Punjab, India.","Humans; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Homeostasis; Alzheimer Disease; Carbon; Immunity",N/A,Journal Article; Review

38268870,[Microbiome and Biliary Tract Cancer].,"Biliary tract cancers encompass a group of malignancies that affect the bile ducts and gallbladder and are associated with a poor prognosis, often due to late diagnosis and limited treatment options. The incidence of biliary tract cancer has been increasing gradually, underscoring the need for a better understanding of its pathogenesis and potential risk factors. Research suggests that biliary tract cancer may develop through a combination of genetic and epigenetic alterations, as well as environmental factors. The role of microbial exposure and the human microbiome in the pathogenesis of biliary tract cancer is an emerging area of interest. Traditionally, the biliary tree was considered sterile under normal conditions, but recent studies have identified associations between specific microbiological patterns and inflammatory biliary diseases and cancer. The human microbiome plays a crucial role in maintaining host homeostasis and interacting with the host's immune system. Dysbiosis, or an imbalance in the microbiome composition, has been implicated in the development of various diseases, including cancer. Hence, dysbiosis in the biliary tract might trigger the pathogenesis of biliary tract cancer.

38266109,The multilevel extensive diversity across the cynomolgus macaque captured by ultra-deep adaptive immune receptor repertoire sequencing.,"The extent to which AIRRs differ among and within individuals remains elusive. Via ultra-deep repertoire sequencing of 22 and 25 tissues in three cynomolgus macaques, respectively, we identified 84 and 114 novel IGHV and TRBV alleles, confirming 72 (85.71%) and 100 (87.72%) of them. The heterogeneous V gene usage patterns were influenced, in turn, by genetics, isotype (for BCRs only), tissue group, and tissue. A higher proportion of intragroup shared clones in the intestinal tissues than those in other tissues suggests a close intra-intestinal adaptive immunity network. Significantly higher mutation burdens in the public clones and the inter-tissue shared IgM and IgD clones indicate that they might target the shared antigens. This study reveals the extensive heterogeneity of the AIRRs at various levels and has broad fundamental and clinical implications.

38266093,DNA Methylation-Based Assessment of Cell Composition in Human Pancreas and Islets.,"Assessment of pancreas cell type composition is crucial to the understanding of the genesis of diabetes. Current approaches use immunodetection of protein markers, for example, insulin as a marker of β-cells. A major limitation of these methods is that protein content varies in physiological and pathological conditions, complicating the extrapolation to actual cell number. Here, we demonstrate the use of cell type-specific DNA methylation markers for determining the fraction of specific cell types in human islet and pancreas specimens. We identified genomic loci that are uniquely demethylated in specific pancreatic cell types and applied targeted PCR to assess the methylation status of these loci in tissue samples, enabling inference of cell type composition. In islet preparations, normalization of insulin secretion to β-cell DNA revealed similar β-cell function in pre-type 1 diabetes (T1D), T1D, and type 2 diabetes (T2D), which was significantly lower than in donors without diabetes.

38256880,Exo70 Promotes the Invasion of Pancreatic Cancer Cells via the Regulation of Exosomes.,"Pancreatic cancer (PC) is an aggressive and fatal malignant tumor, and exosomes have been reported to be closely related to PC invasion and metastasis. Here we found that Exo70, a key subunit of the exocyst complex, promoted PC metastasis by regulating the secretion of tumor exosomes. Clinical sample studies showed that Exo70 was highly expressed in PC and negatively correlated with patients' survival. Exo70 promoted PC cell lines' invasion and migration. Interestingly, knockdown of Exo70, or using an Exo70 inhibitor (ES2) inhibited the secretion of tumor exosomes and increased the accumulation of cellular vesicles. Furthermore, Exo70 was found to accumulate in the exosomes, which then fused with neighboring PC cells and promoted their invasion. Moreover, Exo70 increased the expression of exosomal PD-L1, leading to the immune escape of PC cells. In vivo, knockdown of Exo70 or treatment with ES2 both decreased the tumor metastasis of PC cells in mice. This study provides new insight into the mechanism of invasion and metastasis in PC and identifies Exo70 as a potential prognostic factor and therapeutic target for PC.","Jingzhou Xiang, Bowen Zheng, Lingying Zhao, Yuting He, Fanzhuoran Lou, Runyang Li, Miao Fu, Xintian Huang, Wenqing Zhang, Xiaoting Hong, Li Xiao, Tianhui Hu",Cancers,2024,Exo70; exocyst; exosome; metastasis; pancreatic cancer,10.3390/cancers16020336,"Xiamen Key Laboratory for Tumor Metastasis, Cancer Research Center, School of Medicine, Xiamen University, Xiamen 361102, China.; Xiamen Key Laboratory for Tumor Metastasis, Cancer Research Center, School of Medicine, Xiamen University, Xiamen 361102, China.; Xiamen Key Laboratory for Tumor Metastasis, Cancer Research Center, School of Medicine, Xiamen University, Xiamen 361102, China.; Department of Oncology, Zhongshan Hospital of Xiamen University, School of Medicine, Xiamen University, Xiamen 361004, China.; Department of Oncology, Zhongshan Hospital of Xiamen University, School of Medicine, Xiamen University, Xiamen 361004, China.; Xiamen Key Laboratory for Tumor Metastasis, Cancer Research Center, School of Medicine, Xiamen University, Xiamen 361102, China.; Xiamen Key Laboratory for Tumor Metastasis, Cancer Research Center, School of Medicine, Xiamen University, Xiamen 361102, China.; Department of Oncology, Zhongshan Hospital of Xiamen University, School of Medicine, Xiamen University, Xiamen 361004, China.; Xiamen Key Laboratory for Tumor Metastasis, Cancer Research Center, School of Medicine, Xiamen University, Xiamen 361102, China.; Xiamen Key Laboratory for Tumor Metastasis, Cancer Research Center, School of Medicine, Xiamen University, Xiamen 361102, China.; Xiamen Key Laboratory for Tumor Metastasis, Cancer Research Center, School of Medicine, Xiamen University, Xiamen 361102, China.; Xiamen Key Laboratory for Tumor Metastasis, Cancer Research Center, School of Medicine, Xiamen University, Xiamen 361102, China.",N/A,"the Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province (2021R1001003,2022R1001002) (the Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province (2021R1001003,2022R1001002)); Xiamen Natural Science Foundation Project (3502Z20227266, 3502Z20227157) (Xiamen Natural Science Foundation Project (3502Z20227266, 3502Z20227157)); Shenzhen Science and Technology Program(JCY20220530143406015) (Shenzhen Science and Technology Program(JCY20220530143406015)); Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars in XIAMEN (Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars in XIAMEN)",Journal Article
38254825,Unwrap RAP1's Mystery at Kinetoplastid Telomeres.,"Although located at the chromosome end, telomeres are an essential chromosome component that helps maintain genome integrity and chromosome stability from protozoa to mammals. The role of telomere proteins in chromosome end protection is conserved, where they suppress various DNA damage response machineries and block nucleolytic degradation of the natural chromosome ends, although the detailed underlying mechanisms are not identical. In addition, the specialized telomere structure exerts a repressive epigenetic effect on expression of genes located at subtelomeres in a number of eukaryotic organisms. This so-called telomeric silencing also affects virulence of a number of microbial pathogens that undergo antigenic variation/phenotypic switching. Telomere proteins, particularly the RAP1 homologs, have been shown to be a key player for telomeric silencing. RAP1 homologs also suppress the expression of Telomere Repeat-containing RNA (TERRA), which is linked to their roles in telomere stability maintenance. The functions of RAP1s in suppressing telomere recombination are largely conserved from kinetoplastids to mammals. However, the underlying mechanisms of RAP1-mediated telomeric silencing have many species-specific features.

38254667,Leveraging global investments for polio eradication to strengthen health systems' resilience through transition.,"Since the launch of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative in 1988, more than US$20 billion has been invested globally in polio eradication. The World Health Organization and its partners are currently supporting Member States to transition the functions used to eradicate polio to strengthen their health systems. This study analyses global polio activities through the lens of health systems and the Common Goods for Health (CGH). Polio activities include key health system functions such as surveillance and response systems and immunization, which are essential to maintaining resilient health systems. They also support essential functions such as policy development, planning, training and capacity building, which are often underfunded in many countries. To improve overall resilience, it is critical to continue to integrate these functions into local health systems so that the capacity built through the polio eradication programme can be used for broader public health purposes. It is vital that this integration process be tailored to each country's unique health system context, rather than using a one-size-fits-all approach. While integration of all polio activities into local health systems is ideal, the transition to domestic financing may be coordinated with other global health financing mechanisms. This would reduce funding fragmentation and transaction costs, and allow for a focus on health system functions as a whole rather than just disease-specific efforts. The transition to domestic financing of polio activities could be staggered, prioritizing the transition to domestic funding for activities with limited global externalities, while seeking longer-term external funding for those that are global CGH.","Fabrizio Tediosi, Simone Villa, Darcy Levison, Ebru Ekeman, Claudio Politi",Health policy and planning,2024,Polio eradication; global health financing; health systems resilience; polio transition,10.1093/heapol/czad093,"Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute, Kreuzstrasse 2, Allschwil 4123, Switzerland.; Centre for Multidisciplinary Research in Health Science (MACH), University of Milan, Via Festa del Perdono, 7, Milano, 20122, Italy.; Polio Transition Programme, World Health Organization, 20 Avenue Appia, 1211 Geneva, Switzerland.; Polio Transition Programme, World Health Organization, 20 Avenue Appia, 1211 Geneva, Switzerland.; Polio Transition Programme, World Health Organization, 20 Avenue Appia, 1211 Geneva, Switzerland.","Humans; Resilience, Psychological; Capacity Building; Government Programs; Immunization; Poliomyelitis",001 (World Health Organization),Journal Article
38253450,A comprehensive review on signaling attributes of serine and serine metabolism in health and disease.,"Serine is a metabolite with ever-expanding metabolic and non-metabolic signaling attributes. By providing one‑carbon units for macromolecule biosynthesis and functional modifications, serine and serine metabolism largely impinge on cellular survival and function. Cancer cells frequently have a preference for serine metabolic reprogramming to create a conducive metabolic state for survival and aggressiveness, making intervention of cancer-associated rewiring of serine metabolism a promising therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment. Beyond providing methyl donors for methylation in modulation of innate immunity, serine metabolism generates formyl donors for mitochondrial tRNA formylation which is required for mitochondrial function. Interestingly, fully developed neurons lack the machinery for serine biosynthesis and rely heavily on astrocytic l-serine for production of d-serine to shape synaptic plasticity. Here, we recapitulate recent discoveries that address the medical significance of serine and serine metabolism in malignancies, mitochondrial-associated disorders, and neurodegenerative pathologies. Metabolic control and epigenetic- and posttranslational regulation of serine metabolism are also discussed. Given the metabolic similarities between cancer cells, neurons and germ cells, we further propose the relevance of serine metabolism in testicular homeostasis. Our work provides valuable hints for future investigations that will lead to a deeper understanding of serine and serine metabolism in cellular physiology and pathology.","Di Wu, Kejia Zhang, Faheem Ahmed Khan, Nuruliarizki Shinta Pandupuspitasari, Kaifeng Guan, Fei Sun, Chunjie Huang",International journal of biological macromolecules,2024,Cancer therapeutics; Mitochondrial-associated disorders; Neurodegenerative pathologies; Serine; Serine metabolic reprogramming,10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2024.129607,"Institute of Reproductive Medicine, School of Medicine, Nantong University, Nantong 226001, China.; Institute of Reproductive Medicine, School of Medicine, Nantong University, Nantong 226001, China.; Research Center for Animal Husbandry, National Research and Innovation Agency, Jakarta Pusat 10340, Indonesia.; Faculty of Animal and Agricultural Sciences, Universitas Diponegoro, Semarang 1269, Indonesia.; School of Advanced Agricultural Sciences, Peking University, Beijing 100871, China.

38253153,The role of lymphatic vessels in corneal fluid homeostasis and wound healing.,"The cornea, essential for vision, is normally avascular, transparent, and immune-privileged. However, injuries or infections can break this privilege, allowing blood and lymphatic vessels to invade, potentially impairing vision and causing immune responses. This review explores the complex role of corneal lymphangiogenesis in health and diseases. Traditionally, the cornea was considered devoid of lymphatic vessels, a phenomenon known as ""corneal (lymph)angiogenic privilege."" Recent advances in molecular markers have enabled the discovery of lymphatic vessels in the cornea under certain conditions. Several molecules contribute to preserving both immune and lymphangiogenic privileges. Lymphangiogenesis, primarily driven by VEGF family members, can occur directly or indirectly through macrophage recruitment. Corneal injuries and diseases disrupt these privileges, reducing graft survival rates following transplantation. However, modulation of lymphangiogenesis offers potential interventions to promote graft survival and expedite corneal edema resolution.This review underscores the intricate interplay between lymphatic vessels, immune privilege, and corneal pathologies, highlighting innovative therapeutic possibilities. Future investigations should explore the modulation of lymphangiogenesis to enhance corneal health and transparency, as well as corneal graft survival, and this benefits patients with various corneal conditions.","Karina Hadrian, Claus Cursiefen",Journal of ophthalmic inflammation and infection,2024,Cornea; Corneal edema; Immune cells; Lymphangiogenesis,10.1186/s12348-023-00381-y,"Department of Ophthalmology, Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital Cologne, University of Cologne, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.; Department of Ophthalmology, Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital Cologne, University of Cologne, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany. claus.cursiefen@uk-koeln.de.",N/A,Cu 47/9-1 Cu 47/12-2 Cu 47/15-1 (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft),Journal Article; Review

Our study aimed to characterize patterns of health access to DTP-based combination vaccines in 10 countries from 2019 to 2022 using the IQVIA-MIDAS database. The availability, affordability, and accessibility were compared across countries by national health and economic performance indicators using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Our findings showed that the three aspects of access to DTP-based vaccines varied substantially in the Asia-Pacific region, with higher levels in countries with better health and economic performance. Affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccine accessibility fluctuates significantly in lower-income countries, with DTP coverage rates falling by more than 14% in the Philippines and Indonesia between 2019 and 2021.

38250846,Exploring post-SEPSIS and post-COVID-19 syndromes: crossovers from pathophysiology to therapeutic approach.,"Sepsis, driven by several infections, including COVID-19, can lead to post-sepsis syndrome (PSS) and post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). Both these conditions share clinical and pathophysiological similarities, as survivors face persistent multi-organ dysfunctions, including respiratory, cardiovascular, renal, and neurological issues. Moreover, dysregulated immune responses, immunosuppression, and hyperinflammation contribute to these conditions. The lack of clear definitions and diagnostic criteria hampers comprehensive treatment strategies, and a unified therapeutic approach is significantly needed. One potential target might be the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), which plays a significant role in immune modulation. In fact, RAS imbalance can exacerbate these responses. Potential interventions involving RAS include ACE inhibitors, ACE receptor blockers, and recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2). To address the complexities of PSS and PASC, a multifaceted approach is required, considering shared immunological mechanisms and the role of RAS. Standardization, research funding, and clinical trials are essential for advancing treatment strategies for these conditions.","Darcy Holmes, Marta Colaneri, Emanuele Palomba, Andrea Gori",Frontiers in medicine,2023,angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2); immune dysfunction; post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC); post-sepsis syndrome (PSS); renin-angiotensin system (RAS),10.3389/fmed.2023.1280951,"Infectious Diseases Unit, Foundation IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy.; Department of Infectious Diseases, Luigi Sacco Hospital, Milan, Italy.; Department of Infectious Diseases, Luigi Sacco Hospital, Milan, Italy.; Department of Infectious Diseases, Luigi Sacco Hospital, Milan, Italy.",N/A,N/A,Journal Article; Review

38249480,Climate Stressors and Physiological Dysregulations: Mechanistic Connections to Pathologies.,"This review delves into the complex relationship between environmental factors, their mechanistic cellular and molecular effects, and their significant impact on human health. Climate change is fueled by industrialization and the emission of greenhouse gases and leads to a range of effects, such as the redistribution of disease vectors, higher risks of disease transmission, and shifts in disease patterns. Rising temperatures pose risks to both food supplies and respiratory health. The hypothesis addressed is that environmental stressors including a spectrum of chemical and pathogen exposures as well as physical and psychological influences collectively impact genetics, metabolism, and cellular functions affecting physical and mental health. The objective is to report the mechanistic associations linking environment and health. As environmental stressors intensify, a surge in health conditions, spanning from allergies to neurodegenerative diseases, becomes evident; however, linkage to genetic-altered proteomics is more hidden. Investigations positing that environmental stressors cause mitochondrial dysfunction, metabolic syndrome, and oxidative stress, which affect missense variants and neuro- and immuno-disorders, are reported. These disruptions to homeostasis with dyslipidemia and misfolded and aggregated proteins increase susceptibility to cancers, infections, and autoimmune diseases. Proposed interventions, such as vitamin B supplements and antioxidants, target oxidative stress and may aid mitochondrial respiration and immune balance. The mechanistic interconnections of environmental stressors and disruptions in health need to be unraveled to develop strategies to protect public health.","Hajar Heidari, David A Lawrence",International journal of environmental research and public health,2023,autoimmune disease; chaperones; folate; metabolites; mitochondria; oxidative stress,10.3390/ijerph21010028,"Department of Biomedical Sciences, University at Albany School of Public Health, Rensselaer, NY 12144, USA.; Department of Biomedical Sciences, University at Albany School of Public Health, Rensselaer, NY 12144, USA.",Humans; Animals; Antioxidants; Autoimmune Diseases; Climate Change; Dietary Supplements; Disease Vectors,R01 ES025584 (NIEHS NIH HHS); R33 HD105613 (NICHD NIH HHS); R33HD105613 (NIH HHS),Journal Article; Review

It is not only affect older people but can also occur in young individuals, especially those suffering from chronic inflammatory conditions such as autoimmune disease, malignancy, or chronic infection. This condition led to altered immune function and as consequent immune function is reduced. Detection of immunosenescence has been done by examining the immune risk profile (IRP), which uses flow cytometry. These tests are not always available in health facilities, especially in developing countries and require fresh whole blood samples. Therefore, it is necessary to find biomarkers that can be tested using stored serum to make it easier to refer to the examination. Here we proposed an insight for soluble biomarkers which represented immune cells activities and exhaustion, namely sCD163, sCD28, sCD80, and sCTLA-4. Those markers were reported to be elevated in chronic diseases that caused early aging and easily detected from serum samples using ELISA method, unlike IRP.

38241950,"Role of CD20+ T cells in cancer, autoimmunity and obesity.","Despite the known link between obesity and insulin resistance (IR) to chronic low-grade inflammation, new markers capable of early IR detection are needed. Immune cells are components of adipose tissue's (AT) stromal vascular fraction (SVF) that regulate AT homeostasis. The altered phenotype and function of AT-infiltrating immune cells may contribute to the development and maintenance of local AT inflammation observed under obesity-induced IR conditions. Impaired AT-specific immunometabolic function may influence the whole organism. Therefore, AT-infiltrating immune cells may be important players in the development of obesity-related metabolic complications, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). B and T cells, particularly CD20+ T cells, play important roles in human pathology, such as autoimmune disease and cancer. However, the question remains as to whether CD20+ T cells have an important contribution to the development of obesity-related IR. While circulating CD20+ T cells are mostly of the central memory phenotype (i.e. antigen-experienced T cells with the ability to home to secondary lymphoid organs), tissues-infiltrated CD20+ T cells are predominantly of the effector memory phenotype (i.e. antigen-experienced T cells that preferentially infiltrate peripheral tissues). The latter produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IFN-γ and IL-17, which play a role in obesity-related IR development. This review describes the CD20 molecule and its presence in both B and T cells, shedding light on its ontogeny and function, in health and disease, with emphasis on AT. The link between CD20+ T cell dysregulation, obesity, and IR development supports the role of CD20+ T cells as markers of adipose tissue dysmetabolism.","Aryane Cruz Oliveira Pinho, Paula Laranjeira, Eugenia Carvalho",The Journal of endocrinology,2024,CD20; CD20+ T cell; human pathophysiology; inflammation; obesity,10.1530/JOE-23-0242,"CNC-UC - Center for Neuroscience and Cell Biology, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal.; CNC-UC - Center for Neuroscience and Cell Biology, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal.; CNC-UC - Center for Neuroscience and Cell Biology, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal.","Humans; Autoimmunity; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Adipose Tissue; Obesity; T-Lymphocytes; Inflammation; Neoplasms; Insulin Resistance",N/A,"Review; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

D-2-HG suppresses antitumor T-cell immunity but little is known about potential effects on non-malignant myeloid cells. Here we show that D-2-HG impairs human but not murine dendritic cell differentiation, resulting in a tolerogenic phenotype with low major histocompatibility class II expression. In line with this, IDH-mutated AML blasts exhibited lower expression of HLA-DP and were less susceptible to lysis by HLA-DP-specific T cells. Interestingly, besides its expected impact on DNA demethylation, D-2-HG reprogrammed metabolism towards increased lactate production in dendritic cells and AML. Vitamin C accelerated DNA demethylation, but only the combination of vitamin C and glycolytic inhibition lowered lactate levels and supported major histocompatibility complex class II expression. Our results indicate an unexpected link between the immunosuppressive metabolites 2-HG and lactic acid and suggest a potentially novel therapeutic strategy with combinations of anti-glycolytic drugs and epigenetic modulators (hypomethylating agents) or other therapeutics for the treatment of AML.","Kathrin Hammon, Kathrin Renner, Michael Althammer, Florian Voll, Nathalie Babl, Sonja-Maria Decking, Peter J Siska, Carina Matos, Zugey Elizabeth Cárdenas Conejo, Karina Mendes, Friederike Einwag, Heiko Siegmund, Sabine Iberl, Raffaela S Berger, Katja Dettmer, Rebecca Schoenmehl, Christoph Brochhausen, Wolfgang Herr, Peter J Oefner, Michael Rehli, Simone Thomas, Marina Kreutz",Haematologica,2024,N/A,10.3324/haematol.2023.283597,"Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Regensburg; Regensburg, Germany; LIT - Leibniz Institute for Immunotherapy; Regensburg.; Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Regensburg; Regensburg, Germany; LIT - Leibniz Institute for Immunotherapy; Regensburg, Germany; Department of Otorhinolaryngology, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg.; Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Regensburg; Regensburg.; LIT - Leibniz Institute for Immunotherapy; Regensburg.; Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Regensburg; Regensburg.; Department of Otorhinolaryngology, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg.; Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Regensburg; Regensburg.; Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Regensburg; Regensburg.; Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Regensburg; Regensburg.; Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Regensburg; Regensburg, Germany; Present address: Universidade Católica Portuguesa, Center for Interdisciplinary Research in Health (CIIS), Institute of Health Sciences (ICS); Viseu.; Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Regensburg; Regensburg.; Institute of Pathology, University of Regensburg; Regensburg.; Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Regensburg; Regensburg.; Institute of Functional Genomics, University of Regensburg; Regensburg.; Institute of Functional Genomics, University of Regensburg; Regensburg.; Institute of Pathology, University Medical Center Mannheim, University Heidelberg, Mannheim.; Institute of Pathology, University of Regensburg; Regensburg, Germany; Institute of Pathology, University Medical Center Mannheim, University Heidelberg, Mannheim.; Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Regensburg; Regensburg.; Institute of Functional Genomics, University of Regensburg; Regensburg.; Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Regensburg; Regensburg, Germany; LIT - Leibniz Institute for Immunotherapy; Regensburg.; Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Regensburg; Regensburg, Germany; LIT - Leibniz Institute for Immunotherapy; Regensburg.; Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Regensburg; Regensburg, Germany; LIT - Leibniz Institute for Immunotherapy; Regensburg. marina.kreutz@ukr.de.","Humans; Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute; Dendritic Cells; Glutarates; Mice; Animals; Histocompatibility Antigens Class II; Phenotype; Cell Differentiation; Lactic Acid; Immune Tolerance; Isocitrate Dehydrogenase",N/A,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Comment"

As racially targeted health communication has both potentially beneficial and problematic consequences, it is important to examine this uniquely high-profile case. Using a purposive sample of 10 videos, our thematic content analysis aimed to reveal how racially minoritised people were represented and the types of concerns about the vaccine that were expressed. We found representations of racialised difference that centred on 'community' and invoked shared social experiences. The expressed concerns centred on whether ethnic difference was accounted for in the vaccine's design and development, plus the overarching issue of trust. Our analysis adopts and develops the concept of 'racialisation'; we explore how 'mutuality' underpinned normative calls to action ('ethico-racial imperatives') and how the videos 'responsibilised' racially minoritised people. We discuss two points of tension in this case: the limitations for addressing the causes of mistrust and the risks of reductivism that accompanied the ambiguous notion of community. Our analysis develops scholarship on racialisation in health contexts and provides public health practitioners with insights into the socio-political considerations of racially targeted communications.","Andrew Smart, Ros Williams, Kate Weiner, Lijiaozi Cheng, Francesca Sobande",Sociology of health & illness,2024,COVID‐19; ethnicity; media; public health; race; racialisation,10.1111/1467-9566.13748,"School of Sciences, Bath Spa University, Bath, UK.; Department of Sociological Studies, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK.; Department of Sociological Studies, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK.; Department of Sociological Studies, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK.; School of Journalism, Media and Culture, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.",Humans; COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; United Kingdom; Trust; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccination; Racism; Health Communication,RGDA_AS_061221 (Foundation for the Sociology of Health and Illness),Journal Article

38232073,Mitochondrial Function in Health and Disease: Responses to Helicobacter pylori Metabolism and Impact in Gastric Cancer Development.,"Mitochondria are major cellular organelles that play an essential role in metabolism, stress response, immunity, and cell fate. Mitochondria are organized in a network with other cellular compartments, functioning as a signaling hub to maintain cells' health. Mitochondrial dysfunctions and genome alterations are associated with diseases including cancer. Mitochondria are a preferential target for pathogens, which have developed various mechanisms to hijack cellular functions for their benefit. Helicobacter pylori is recognized as the major risk factor for gastric cancer development. H. pylori induces oxidative stress and chronic gastric inflammation associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. Its pro-apoptotic cytotoxin VacA interacts with the mitochondrial inner membrane, leading to increased permeability and decreased ATP production. Furthermore, H. pylori induces mitochondrial DNA damage and mutation, concomitant with the development of gastric intraepithelial neoplasia as observed in infected mice. In this chapter, we present diverse aspects of the role of mitochondria as energy supplier and signaling hubs and their adaptation to stress conditions. The metabolic activity of mitochondria is directly linked to biosynthetic pathways. While H. pylori virulence factors and derived metabolites are essential for gastric colonization and niche adaptation, they may also impact mitochondrial function and metabolism, and may have consequences in gastric pathogenesis. Importantly, during its long way to reach the gastric epithelium, H. pylori faces various cellular types along the gastric mucosa. We discuss how the mitochondrial response of these different cells is affected by H. pylori and impacts the colonization and bacterium niche adaptation and point to areas that remain to be investigated.","Javier Torres, Eliette Touati",Current topics in microbiology and immunology,2023,Gastric carcinogenesis; H. pylori; Metabolites; Mitochondria; VacA toxin,10.1007/978-3-031-47331-9_3,"Unidad de Investigacion en Enfermedades Infecciosas, UMAE Pediatriıa, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.; Equipe DMic01-Infection, Génotoxicité et Cancer, Département de Microbiologie, UMR CNRS 6047, Institut Pasteur, Université Paris Cité, F-75015, Paris, France. eliette.touati@pasteur.fr.",Animals; Mice; Stomach Neoplasms; Helicobacter pylori; Mitochondria; Mitochondrial Membranes,N/A,Journal Article
38231215,The roles of tissue resident macrophages in health and cancer.,"As integral components of the immune microenvironment, tissue resident macrophages (TRMs) represent a self-renewing and long-lived cell population that plays crucial roles in maintaining homeostasis, promoting tissue remodeling after damage, defending against inflammation and even orchestrating cancer progression. However, the exact functions and roles of TRMs in cancer are not yet well understood. TRMs exhibit either pro-tumorigenic or anti-tumorigenic effects by engaging in phagocytosis and secreting diverse cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors to modulate the adaptive immune system. The life-span, turnover kinetics and monocyte replenishment of TRMs vary among different organs, adding to the complexity and controversial findings in TRMs studies. Considering the complexity of tissue associated macrophage origin, macrophages targeting strategy of each ontogeny should be carefully evaluated. Consequently, acquiring a comprehensive understanding of TRMs' origin, function, homeostasis, characteristics, and their roles in cancer for each specific organ holds significant research value. In this review, we aim to provide an outline of homeostasis and characteristics of resident macrophages in the lung, liver, brain, skin and intestinal, as well as their roles in modulating primary and metastatic cancer, which may inform and serve the future design of targeted therapies.","Minmin Cao, Zihao Wang, Wanying Lan, Binghua Xiang, Wenjun Liao, Jie Zhou, Xiaomeng Liu, Yiling Wang, Shichuan Zhang, Shun Lu, Jinyi Lang, Yue Zhao",Experimental hematology & oncology,2024,Bone-marrow derived macrophages; Cancer; Homeostasis; Monocytes; Tissue resident macrophages,10.1186/s40164-023-00469-0,"School of Basic Medical Sciences, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, China.; Department of Radiation Oncology, Radiation Oncology Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Sichuan Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Sichuan Cancer Hospital & Institute, Sichuan Cancer Center, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China.; Department of Radiation Oncology, Radiation Oncology Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Sichuan Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Sichuan Cancer Hospital & Institute, Sichuan Cancer Center, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China.; Department of Radiation Oncology, Radiation Oncology Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Sichuan Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Sichuan Cancer Hospital & Institute, Sichuan Cancer Center, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China.; Department of Radiation Oncology, Radiation Oncology Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Sichuan Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Sichuan Cancer Hospital & Institute, Sichuan Cancer Center, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China.; Department of Radiation Oncology, Radiation Oncology Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Sichuan Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Sichuan Cancer Hospital & Institute, Sichuan Cancer Center, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China.; Department of Radiation Oncology, Radiation Oncology Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Sichuan Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Sichuan Cancer Hospital & Institute, Sichuan Cancer Center, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China.; Department of Radiation Oncology, Radiation Oncology Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Sichuan Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Sichuan Cancer Hospital & Institute, Sichuan Cancer Center, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China.; Department of Radiation Oncology, Radiation Oncology Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Sichuan Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Sichuan Cancer Hospital & Institute, Sichuan Cancer Center, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China.; Department of Radiation Oncology, Radiation Oncology Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Sichuan Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Sichuan Cancer Hospital & Institute, Sichuan Cancer Center, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China.; Department of Radiation Oncology, Radiation Oncology Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Sichuan Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Sichuan Cancer Hospital & Institute, Sichuan Cancer Center, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China.; Department of Radiation Oncology, Radiation Oncology Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Sichuan Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Sichuan Cancer Hospital & Institute, Sichuan Cancer Center, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China.

38216855,Post-translational modulation of cell signalling through protein succinylation.,"Cells need to adapt their activities to extra- and intracellular signalling cues. To translate a received extracellular signal, cells have specific receptors that transmit the signal to downstream proteins so that it can reach the nucleus to initiate or repress gene transcription. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) of proteins are reversible or irreversible chemical modifications that help to further modulate protein activity. The most commonly observed PTMs are the phosphorylation of serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues, followed by acetylation, glycosylation, and amidation. In addition to PTMs that involve the modification of a certain amino acid (phosphorylation, hydrophobic groups for membrane localisation, or chemical groups like acylation), or the conjugation of peptides (SUMOylation, NEDDylation), structural changes such as the formation of disulphide bridge, protein cleavage or splicing can also be classified as PTMs. Recently, it was discovered that metabolites from the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle are not only intermediates that support cellular metabolism but can also modify lysine residues. This has been shown for acetate, succinate, and lactate, among others. Due to the importance of mitochondria for the overall fitness of organisms, the regulatory function of such PTMs is critical for protection from aging, neurodegeneration, or cardiovascular disease. Cancer cells and activated immune cells display a phenotype of accelerated metabolic activity known as the Warburg effect. This metabolic state is characterised by enhanced glycolysis, the use of the pentose phosphate pathway as well as a disruption of the TCA cycle, ultimately causing the accumulation of metabolites like citrate, succinate, and malate. Succinate can then serve as a signalling molecule by directly interacting with proteins, by binding to its G protein-coupled receptor 91 (GPR91) and by post-translationally modifying proteins through succinylation of lysine residues, respectively. This review is focus on the process of protein succinylation and its importance in health and disease.","Katharina F Kubatzky, Yue Gao, Dayoung Yu",Exploration of targeted anti-tumor therapy,2023,Succinate; cancer; immune system; lysine succinylation; metabolites; mitochondria; post-translational modifications,10.37349/etat.2023.00196,"Department of Infectious Diseases, Medical Faculty Heidelberg, Medical Microbiology and Hygiene, Heidelberg University, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.; Department of Infectious Diseases, Medical Faculty Heidelberg, Medical Microbiology and Hygiene, Heidelberg University, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.; Department of Infectious Diseases, Medical Faculty Heidelberg, Medical Microbiology and Hygiene, Heidelberg University, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.",N/A,N/A,Journal Article; Review
38213532,Imaging of brain barrier inflammation and brain fluid drainage in human neurological diseases.,"The intricate relationship between the central nervous system (CNS) and the immune system plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of various neurological diseases. Understanding the interactions among the immunopathological processes at the brain borders is essential for advancing our knowledge of disease mechanisms and developing novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. In this review, we explore the emerging role of neuroimaging in providing valuable insights into brain barrier inflammation and brain fluid drainage in human neurological diseases. Neuroimaging techniques have enabled us not only to visualize and assess brain structures, but also to study the dynamics of the CNS in health and disease in vivo. By analyzing imaging findings, we can gain a deeper understanding of the immunopathology observed at the brain-immune interface barriers, which serve as critical gatekeepers that regulate immune cell trafficking, cytokine release, and clearance of waste products from the brain. This review explores the integration of neuroimaging data with immunopathological findings, providing valuable insights into brain barrier integrity and immune responses in neurological diseases. Such integration may lead to the development of novel diagnostic markers and targeted therapeutic approaches that can benefit patients with neurological disorders.","Serhat V Okar, Francesca Fagiani, Martina Absinta, Daniel S Reich",Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS,2024,Choroid plexus; Dural lymphatics; Glymphatic system; Imaging; Leptomeninges; Perivascular spaces,10.1007/s00018-023-05073-3,"Translational Neuroradiology Section, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, 20892, USA.; Translational Neuropathology Unit, Division of Neuroscience, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, 20132, Milan, Italy.; Translational Neuropathology Unit, Division of Neuroscience, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, 20132, Milan, Italy. absinta.martina@hsr.it.; Translational Neuroradiology Section, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, 20892, USA. reichds@ninds.nih.gov.",Humans; Glymphatic System; Brain; Central Nervous System; Nervous System Diseases; Inflammation; Blood-Brain Barrier,ZIA NS003119 (Intramural NIH HHS),Journal Article; Review
38212566,User-experience testing of an evidence-to-decision framework for selecting essential medicines.,"Essential medicine lists (EMLs) are important medicine prioritization tools used by the World Health Organization (WHO) EML and over 130 countries. The criteria used by WHO's Expert Committee on the Selection and Use of Essential Medicines has parallels to the GRADE Evidence-to-Decision (EtD) frameworks. In this study, we explored the EtD frameworks and a visual abstract as adjunctive tools to strengthen the integrate evidence and improve the transparency of decisions of EML applications. We conducted user-experience testing interviews of key EML stakeholders using Morville's honeycomb model. Interviews explored multifaceted dimensions (e.g., usability) on two EML applications for the 2021 WHO EML-long-acting insulin analogues for diabetes and immune checkpoint inhibitors for lung cancer. Using a pre-determined coding framework and thematic analysis we iteratively improved both the EtD framework and the visual abstract. We coded the transcripts of 17 interviews with 13 respondents in 103 locations of the interview texts across all dimensions of the user-experience honeycomb. Respondents felt the EtD framework and visual abstract presented complementary useful and findable adjuncts to the traditional EML application. They felt this would increase transparency and efficiency in evidence assessed by EML committees. As EtD frameworks are also used in health practice guidelines, including those by the WHO, respondents articulated that the adoption of the EtD by EML applications represents a tangible mechanism to align EMLs and guidelines, decrease duplication of work and improve coordination. Improvements were made to clarify instructions for the EtD and visual abstract, and to refine the design and content included. 'Availability' was added as an additional criterion for EML applications to highlight this criterion in alignment with WHO EML criteria. EtD frameworks and visual abstracts present additional important tools to communicate evidence and support decision-criteria in EML applications, which have global health impact. Access to essential medicines is important for achieving universal health coverage, and the development of essential medicine lists should be as evidence-based and trustworthy as possible.","Thomas Piggott, Lorenzo Moja, Carlos A Cuello Garcia, Elie A Akl, Rita Banzi, Benedikt Huttner, Tamara Kredo, John N Lavis, Holger J Schünemann",PLOS global public health,2024,N/A,10.1371/journal.pgph.0002723,"Department of Health Research Methods, Evidence, and Impact, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada.; Department of Essential Medicines and Health Products, World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland.; Department of Health Research Methods, Evidence, and Impact, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada.; Department of Health Research Methods, Evidence, and Impact, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada.; Mario Negri Institute for Pharmacological Research IRCCS, Milan, Italy.; Department of Essential Medicines and Health Products, World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland.; Cochrane South Africa, South African Medical Research Council, Cape Town, South Africa.; McMaster Health Forum, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada.; Department of Health Research Methods, Evidence, and Impact, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada.",N/A,001 (World Health Organization),Journal Article

38203754,Enhancing Immunotherapy in Ovarian Cancer: The Emerging Role of Metformin and Statins.,"Ovarian cancer metastization is accompanied by the development of malignant ascites, which are associated with poor prognosis. The acellular fraction of this ascitic fluid contains tumor-promoting soluble factors, bioactive lipids, cytokines, and extracellular vesicles, all of which communicate with the tumor cells within this peritoneal fluid. Metabolomic profiling of ovarian cancer ascites has revealed significant differences in the pathways of fatty acids, cholesterol, glucose, and insulin. The proteins involved in these pathways promote tumor growth, resistance to chemotherapy, and immune evasion. Unveiling the key role of this liquid tumor microenvironment is crucial for discovering more efficient treatment options. This review focuses on the cholesterol and insulin pathways in ovarian cancer, identifying statins and metformin as viable treatment options when combined with standard chemotherapy. These findings are supported by clinical trials showing improved overall survival with these combinations. Additionally, statins and metformin are associated with the reversal of T-cell exhaustion, positioning these drugs as potential combinatory strategies to improve immunotherapy outcomes in ovarian cancer patients.","Diana Luísa Almeida-Nunes, Ricardo Silvestre, Ricardo Jorge Dinis-Oliveira, Sara Ricardo",International journal of molecular sciences,2023,T-cell exhaustion; clinical trials; drug repurposing; ovarian cancer metabolomics,10.3390/ijms25010323,"Differentiation and Cancer Group, Institute for Research and Innovation in Health (i3S) of the University of Porto, 4200-135 Porto, Portugal.; Life and Health Sciences Research Institute (ICVS), School of Medicine, University of Minho, 4710-057 Braga, Portugal.; 1H-TOXRUN-One Health Toxicology Research Unit, University Institute of Health Sciences, CESPU, CRL, 4585-116 Gandra, Portugal.; Differentiation and Cancer Group, Institute for Research and Innovation in Health (i3S) of the University of Porto, 4200-135 Porto, Portugal.",Humans; Female; Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors; Metformin; Ascites; Ovarian Neoplasms; Insulin; Immunotherapy; Cholesterol; Tumor Microenvironment,"2020.00185.CEECIND (Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia/Ministério da Ciência, Tecnologia e Ensino Superior (FCT)); 2021.05081.BD (Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia/Ministério da Ciência, Tecnologia e Ensino Superior (FCT)); UIDB/50026/2020 (Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia/Ministério da Ciência, Tecnologia e Ensino Superior (FCT)); UIDP/50026/2020 (Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia/Ministério da Ciência, Tecnologia e Ensino Superior (FCT))",Journal Article; Review

38201279,Functional maturation of cytochromes P450 3A4 and 2D6 relies on GAPDH- and Hsp90-Dependent heme allocation.,"Cytochrome P450 3A4 and 2D6 (EC 1.14.13.97 and 1.14.14.1; CYP3A4 and 2D6) are heme-containing enzymes that catalyze the oxidation of a wide number of xenobiotic and drug substrates and thus broadly impact human biology and pharmacologic therapies. Although their activities are directly proportional to their heme contents, little is known about the cellular heme delivery and insertion processes that enable their maturation to functional form. We investigated the potential involvement of GAPDH and chaperone Hsp90, based on our previous studies linking these proteins to intracellular heme allocation. We studied heme delivery and insertion into CYP3A4 and 2D6 after they were transiently expressed in HEK293T and GlyA CHO cells or when naturally expressed in HEPG2 cells in response to rifampicin, and also investigated their associations with GAPDH and Hsp90 in cells. The results indicate that GAPDH and its heme binding function is involved in delivery of mitochondria-generated heme to apo-CYP3A4 and 2D6, and that cell chaperone Hsp90 is additionally involved in driving their heme insertions. Uncovering how cells allocate heme to CYP3A4 and 2D6 provides new insight on their maturation processes and how this may help to regulate their functions in health and disease.","Sidra Islam, Dhanya Thamaraparambil Jayaram, Pranjal Biswas, Dennis J Stuehr",The Journal of biological chemistry,2024,chaperone; drug metabolism; heme protein; heme trafficking; iron; monooxygenase,10.1016/j.jbc.2024.105633,"Department of Inflammation and Immunity, Lerner Research Institute, The Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.; Department of Inflammation and Immunity, Lerner Research Institute, The Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.; Department of Inflammation and Immunity, Lerner Research Institute, The Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.; Department of Inflammation and Immunity, Lerner Research Institute, The Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.

38199567,Nutritional regulation of microbiota-derived metabolites: Implications for immunity and inflammation.,"Nutrition profoundly shapes immunity and inflammation across the lifespan of mammals, from pre- and post-natal periods to later life. Emerging insights into diet-microbiota interactions indicate that nutrition has a dominant influence on the composition-and metabolic output-of the intestinal microbiota, which in turn has major consequences for host immunity and inflammation. Here, we discuss recent findings that support the concept that dietary effects on microbiota-derived metabolites potently alter immune responses in health and disease. We discuss how specific dietary components and metabolites can be either pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory in a context- and tissue-dependent manner during infection, chronic inflammation, and cancer. Together, these studies emphasize the influence of diet-microbiota crosstalk on immune regulation that will have a significant impact on precision nutrition approaches and therapeutic interventions for managing inflammation, infection, and cancer immunotherapy.","Mohammad Arifuzzaman, Nicholas Collins, Chun-Jun Guo, David Artis",Immunity,2024,N/A,10.1016/j.immuni.2023.12.009,"Jill Roberts Institute for Research in Inflammatory Bowel Disease, Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Joan and Sanford I.

38198849,"High prevalence of high-risk HPV genotypes in individuals attending an infectious diseases clinic from 2018 to 2022 in Milan, Italy.","Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection, linked to several types of lesions. HPV, specifically HPV 16, accounts for most of anal cancer cases. In this study, we evaluated the proportion of samples tested positive for HPV and characterized genotypes distribution in anal specimens collected from individuals at risk of anal HPV infection attending from 2018 to 2022 a large Infectious Diseases Department in Italy. The presence of HPV DNA was investigated through a commercial kit detecting 12 HR-HPV, 8 probable/possible HR-HPV, and 8 LR-HPV genotypes. Among 1514 samples, 84% (1266/1514) resulted positive for any type of HPV. The prevalence of high-risk HPV types remained high during all the years of the study period, from 2018 to 2022, ranging from 65% to 73%. Most of HR-HPV, LR-HPV and HPV 16 positive samples were collected from men >45 years. HPV 16 was also the most frequent type in men and women. We did not observe significant variations between years in detection of HR-HPV, instead of LR-HPV, that significantly decreased. In conclusion, the high prevalence of oncogenic HPV genotypes underlines the necessity of clear anal HPV screening guidelines and, along with frequent HR-HPV coinfections, reinforces the urge to intensify the anti-HPV vaccination campaign.","Alberto Rizzo, Davide Moschese, Federica Salari, Andrea Giacomelli, Loriana Morelli, Maria Vittoria Cossu, Chiara Fusetti, Francesco Petri, Giacomo Casalini, Andrea Poloni, Samuel Lazzarin, Andrea Gori, Spinello Antinori, Maria Rita Gismondo, Alessandra Lombardi, Giuliano Rizzardini",Journal of medical virology,2024,HIV; HPV; HPV 16; STI; anal canal,10.1002/jmv.29370,"Laboratory of Clinical Microbiology, Virology and Bioemergencies-""Luigi Sacco"" University Hospital, ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco, Milan, Italy.; I Division of Infectious Diseases, ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco, Luigi Sacco Hospital, Milan, Italy.; Laboratory of Clinical Microbiology, Virology and Bioemergencies-""Luigi Sacco"" University Hospital, ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco, Milan, Italy.; III Division of Infectious Diseases, ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco, Luigi Sacco Hospital, Milan, Italy.; Laboratory of Clinical Microbiology, Virology and Bioemergencies-""Luigi Sacco"" University Hospital, ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco, Milan, Italy.; I Division of Infectious Diseases, ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco, Luigi Sacco Hospital, Milan, Italy.; II Infectious Diseases Unit, Ospedale Luigi Sacco, ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco, Milan, Italy.; II Infectious Diseases Unit, Ospedale Luigi Sacco, ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco, Milan, Italy.; III Division of Infectious Diseases, ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco, Luigi Sacco Hospital, Milan, Italy.; III Division of Infectious Diseases, ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco, Luigi Sacco Hospital, Milan, Italy.; III Division of Infectious Diseases, ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco, Luigi Sacco Hospital, Milan, Italy.; II Infectious Diseases Unit, Ospedale Luigi Sacco, ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco, Milan, Italy.; III Division of Infectious Diseases, ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco, Luigi Sacco Hospital, Milan, Italy.; Laboratory of Clinical Microbiology, Virology and Bioemergencies-""Luigi Sacco"" University Hospital, ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco, Milan, Italy.; Laboratory of Clinical Microbiology, Virology and Bioemergencies-""Luigi Sacco"" University Hospital, ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco, Milan, Italy.; I Division of Infectious Diseases, ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco, Luigi Sacco Hospital, Milan, Italy.",Male; Humans; Female; Prevalence; Papillomavirus Infections; Human papillomavirus 16; Italy; Genotype,N/A,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"
38197518,A critical review on intestinal mucosal barrier protection effects of dietary polysaccharides.,"Studies have shown that dietary polysaccharides, which are widely present in natural foods, have an important impact on the intestinal mucosal barrier. Dietary polysaccharides can maintain the intestinal barrier function through multiple mechanisms. The intestinal barrier is composed of mechanical, chemical, immune, and biological barriers, and dietary polysaccharides, as a bioactive component, can promote and regulate these four barriers. Dietary polysaccharides can enhance the expression of tight junction proteins and mucins such as occludin-1 and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) between intestinal epithelial cells, inhibit inflammatory response and oxidative stress, increase the growth of beneficial bacteria, produce beneficial metabolites such as short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and promote the proliferation and metabolism of immune cells. Given the critical role of the intestinal mucosal system in health and disease, the protective effects of dietary polysaccharides may be potentially valuable for the prevention and treatment of gut-related diseases. Therefore, it is of great significance to further study the mechanism and application prospects of the intestinal mucosal barrier derived from plant, animal, fungal and bacterial sources.","Weiqi Yan, Jinhai Luo, Zhiling Yu, Baojun Xu",Food & function,2024,N/A,10.1039/d3fo03412g,"Food Science and Technology Program, Department of Life Sciences, BNU-HKBU United International College, China.

38197139,Deep Learning Pipeline for Automated Cell Profiling from Cyclic Imaging.,"Recent advances in microscopy allow scientists to generate vast amounts of biological data from a single biopsy sample. Cyclic fluorescence microscopy, in particular, enables multiple targets to be detected simultaneously. This, in turn, has deepened our understanding of tissue composition, cell-to-cell interactions, and cell signaling. Unfortunately, analysis of these datasets can be time-prohibitive due to the sheer volume of data. In this paper, we present CycloNET, a computational pipeline tailored for analyzing raw fluorescent images obtained through cyclic immunofluorescence. The automated pipeline pre-processes raw image files, quickly corrects for translation errors between imaging cycles, and leverages a pre-trained neural network to segment individual cells and generate single-cell molecular profiles. We applied CycloNET to a dataset of 22 human samples from head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients and trained a neural network to segment immune cells. CycloNET efficiently processed a large-scale dataset (17 fields of view per cycle and 13 staining cycles per specimen) in 10 minutes, delivering insights at the single-cell resolution and facilitating the identification of rare immune cell clusters. We expect that this rapid pipeline will serve as a powerful tool to understand complex biological systems at the cellular level, with the potential to facilitate breakthroughs in areas such as developmental biology, disease pathology, and personalized medicine.","Christian Landeros, Juhyun Oh, Ralph Weissleder, Hakho Lee",Research square,2023,N/A,10.21203/rs.3.rs-3745061/v1,"Center for Systems Biology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA 02114, USA.; Center for Systems Biology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA 02114, USA.; Center for Systems Biology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA 02114, USA.; Center for Systems Biology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA 02114, USA.",N/A,U01 CA279858 (NCI NIH HHS); R01 CA239078 (NCI NIH HHS); R01 HL163513 (NHLBI NIH HHS); R21 CA267222 (NCI NIH HHS); R01 CA257623 (NCI NIH HHS); R01 CA264363 (NCI NIH HHS); U01 CA284982 (NCI NIH HHS); R01 CA237500 (NCI NIH HHS),Preprint

38196575,Behavioral and inflammatory changes in rats induced by a three-hit stress model: Implications for psychiatric disorders.,"Many aspects of the impact of childhood trauma remain unknown, such as the age at which individuals are most vulnerable to trauma, whether traumatic experiences have more severe and lasting effects when experienced early in life, and whether early life trauma causes psychiatric conditions such as anxiety and major depressive disorder (MDD) that persist over time or evolve into other disorders. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the impact of traumatic experiences in childhood on susceptibility to mood disorders in adulthood, particularly MDD. Animal models were used to address these questions, and different stressor protocols at various stages of the offspring's life were used. Three-hit starting with injections of Poly: IC was performed on the 9th day of gestation and then considered the first stressor. After birth, the animals were exposed to the maternal deprivation (MD) protocol, which separated the pups from the mother 3 h a day during the first ten days of life. From the 60th day of life, the animals were divided to receive the chronic mild stress (CMS) protocol over 21 days. The stressors can induce anxiety-like behaviors, such as increased locomotor activity through a maternal immune activation protocol using Poly: IC and demonstrating depressive-like behaviors through the MD and CMS protocols. It also showed changes in brain structures for pro-inflammatory parameters, IL-1β and TNF-α, and alterations in anti-inflammatory parameters, IL-4 and IL-10, at different ages of life. The study also found that regulating pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines is necessary for appropriate neuronal behavior, and stress responses can be both friendly and enemy, with costs and benefits balanced to provide the best-fit result.

38192401,Insights into the Therapeutic and Pharmacological Properties of Resveratrol as a Nutraceutical Antioxidant Polyphenol in Health Promotion and Disease Prevention.,"Resveratrol (3, 5, 4'-trihydroxystilbene) is a polyphenolic derivative with herbal origin. It has attracted considerable attention in recent decades. Many studies have revealed the benefits of Resveratrol over several human disease models, including heart and neurological diseases, nephroprotective, immune regulation, antidiabetic, anti-obesity, age-related diseases, antiviral, and anticancer in experimental and clinical conditions. Recently, the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of Resveratrol have been observed, and it has been shown that Resveratrol reduces inflammatory biomarkers, such as tissue degradation factor, cyclooxygenase 2, nitric oxide synthase, and interleukins. All of these activities appear to be dependent on its structural properties, such as the number and position of the hydroxyl group, which regulates oxidative stress, cell death, and inflammation. Resveratrol is well tolerated and safe even at higher pharmacological doses and desirably affects cardiovascular, neurological, and diabetic diseases. Consequently, it is plausible that Resveratrol can be regarded as a beneficial nutritional additive and a complementary drug, particularly for therapeutic applications. The present review provides an overview of currently available investigations on preventive and therapeutic characteristics and the main molecular mechanisms of Resveratrol and its potent derivatives in various diseases. Thus, this review would enhance knowledge and information about Resveratrol and encourage researchers worldwide to consider it as a pharmaceutical drug to struggle with future health crises against different human disorders.","Shiva Mohammadi, Maryam Dalaei Moghadam, Maryam Nasiriasl, Morteza Akhzari, Mahdi Barazesh",Current reviews in clinical and experimental pharmacology,2024,Natural compound; phytoalexin; polyphenol; resveratrol; safety profile; therapeutic dose.; viniferine,10.2174/0127724328268507231218051058,"Department of Medical Biotechnology, School of Medicine, Lorestan University of Medical Sciences, Khorramabad, Iran.; Razi Herbal Medicines Research Center, Department of Endodontic, Faculty of Dentistry, Lorestan University of Medical Sciences, Khorramabad, Iran.; Radiology Department, Fasa University of Medical Sciences, Fasa, Iran.; School of Nursing, Larestan University of Medical Sciences, Larestan, Iran.; School of Paramedical Sciences, Gerash University of Medical Sciences, Gerash, Iran.",Humans; Resveratrol; Antioxidants; Animals; Dietary Supplements; Polyphenols; Health Promotion; Stilbenes; Oxidative Stress; Anti-Inflammatory Agents,"3545, IR.LUMS.REC.1402.320 (Research Fund of Lorestan University of Medical Sciences)",Journal Article; Review

38190050,Pyroptosis in health and disease.,"The field of cell death has witnessed significant advancements since the initial discovery of apoptosis in the 1970s. This review delves into the intricacies of pyroptosis, a more recently identified form of regulated, lytic cell death, and explores the roles of pyroptotic effector molecules, with a strong emphasis on their mechanisms and relevance in various diseases. Pyroptosis, characterized by its proinflammatory nature, is driven by the accumulation of large plasma membrane pores comprised of gasdermin family protein subunits. In different contexts of cellular homeostatic perturbations, infections, and tissue damage, proteases, such as caspase-1 and caspase-4/5, play pivotal roles in pyroptosis by cleaving gasdermins. Gasdermin-D (GSDMD), the most extensively studied member of the gasdermin protein family, is expressed in various immune cells and certain epithelial cells. Upon cleavage by caspases, GSDMD oligomerizes and forms transmembrane pores in the cell membrane, leading to the release of proinflammatory cytokines.

38186941,Roles and regulation of tRNA-derived small RNAs in animals.,"A growing class of small RNAs, known as tRNA-derived RNAs (tdRs), tRNA-derived small RNAs or tRNA-derived fragments, have long been considered mere intermediates of tRNA degradation. These small RNAs have recently been implicated in an evolutionarily conserved repertoire of biological processes. In this Review, we discuss the biogenesis and molecular functions of tdRs in mammals, including tdR-mediated gene regulation in cell metabolism, immune responses, transgenerational inheritance, development and cancer. We also discuss the accumulation of tRNA-derived stress-induced RNAs as a distinct adaptive cellular response to pathophysiological conditions. Furthermore, we highlight new conceptual advances linking RNA modifications with tdR activities and discuss challenges in studying tdR biology in health and disease.","Sowndarya Muthukumar, Cai-Tao Li, Ru-Juan Liu, Cristian Bellodi",Nature reviews.

Markers present in the OMIP allow the profiling of neutrophil subsets associated with ontogeny, migration, phagocytosis capacity, granule release, and immune modulation. For panel design, we ensured that the commonly available fluorophores FITC/AF488, PE, and APC were assigned to the intracellular subset marker Olfactomedin 4, the maturity and activation marker CD10, and whole blood subset marker CD177, respectively. These markers can be easily replaced without affecting the core identification of neutrophils, enabling antibodies to new neutrophil antigens of interest or for fluorescent substrates to assess different neutrophil functions to be easily explored. Panel optimization was performed on whole blood and purified neutrophils. We demonstrate applications on clinical samples (whole blood and saliva) and experimental endpoints (purified neutrophils stimulated through an in vitro transmigration assay). We hope that providing a uniform platform to analyze neutrophil plasticity in various sample types will facilitate the future understanding of neutrophil subsets in health and disease.","Craig J Schofield, Rabindra Tirouvanziam, Luke W Garratt",Cytometry.

38178088,The role of inflammasomes in human diseases and their potential as therapeutic targets.,"Inflammasomes are large protein complexes that play a major role in sensing inflammatory signals and triggering the innate immune response. Each inflammasome complex has three major components: an upstream sensor molecule that is connected to a downstream effector protein such as caspase-1 through the adapter protein ASC. Inflammasome formation typically occurs in response to infectious agents or cellular damage. The active inflammasome then triggers caspase-1 activation, followed by the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and pyroptotic cell death. Aberrant inflammasome activation and activity contribute to the development of diabetes, cancer, and several cardiovascular and neurodegenerative disorders. As a result, recent research has increasingly focused on investigating the mechanisms that regulate inflammasome assembly and activation, as well as the potential of targeting inflammasomes to treat various diseases. Multiple clinical trials are currently underway to evaluate the therapeutic potential of several distinct inflammasome-targeting therapies. Therefore, understanding how different inflammasomes contribute to disease pathology may have significant implications for developing novel therapeutic strategies. In this article, we provide a summary of the biological and pathological roles of inflammasomes in health and disease. We also highlight key evidence that suggests targeting inflammasomes could be a novel strategy for developing new disease-modifying therapies that may be effective in several conditions.","Jing Yao, Keenan Sterling, Zhe Wang, Yun Zhang, Weihong Song",Signal transduction and targeted therapy,2024,N/A,10.1038/s41392-023-01687-y,"The National Clinical Research Center for Geriatric Disease, Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, 100053, China.; Townsend Family Laboratories, Department of Psychiatry, Brain Research Center, The University of British Columbia, 2255 Wesbrook Mall, Vancouver, BC, V6T 1Z3, Canada.; The National Clinical Research Center for Geriatric Disease, Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, 100053, China.; The National Clinical Research Center for Geriatric Disease, Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, 100053, China. zhangyun@xwhosp.org.; The National Clinical Research Center for Geriatric Disease, Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, 100053, China. weihong@wmu.edu.cn.","Humans; Inflammasomes; Immunity, Innate; Cell Death; Pyroptosis; Caspase 1",N/A,Journal Article; Review
38177104,The spatial transcriptomic landscape of human gingiva in health and periodontitis.,"The gingiva is a key oral barrier that protects oral tissues from various stimuli. A loss of gingival tissue homeostasis causes periodontitis, one of the most prevalent inflammatory diseases in humans. The human gingiva exists as a complex cell network comprising specialized structures. To understand the tissue-specific pathophysiology of the gingiva, we applied a recently developed spatial enhanced resolution omics-sequencing (Stereo-seq) technique to obtain a spatial transcriptome (ST) atlas of the gingiva in healthy individuals and periodontitis patients. By utilizing Stereo-seq, we identified the major cell types present in the gingiva, which included epithelial cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and immune cells, as well as subgroups of epithelial cells and immune cells. We further observed that inflammation-related signalling pathways, such as the JAK-STAT and NF-κB signalling pathways, were significantly upregulated in the endothelial cells of the gingiva of periodontitis patients compared with those of healthy individuals. Additionally, we characterized the spatial distribution of periodontitis risk genes in the gingiva and found that the expression of IFI16 was significantly increased in endothelial cells of inflamed gingiva. In conclusion, our Stereo-seq findings may facilitate the development of innovative therapeutic strategies for periodontitis by mapping periodontitis-relevant genes and pathways and effector cells.","Zongshan Shen, Ran Zhang, Yunjia Huang, Jiayao Chen, Mengjun Yu, Chunhua Li, Yong Zhang, Lingling Chen, Xin Huang, Jichen Yang, Zhengmei Lin, Songlin Wang, Bin Cheng",Science China.

38172357,Deciphering microglia phenotypes in health and disease.,"Microglia are the major immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS) that perform numerous adaptive functions required for normal CNS development and homeostasis but are also linked to neurodegenerative and behavioral diseases. Microglia development and function are strongly influenced by brain environmental signals that are integrated at the level of transcriptional enhancers to drive specific programs of gene expression. Here, we describe a conceptual framework for how lineage-determining and signal-dependent transcription factors interact to select and regulate the ensembles of enhancers that determine microglia development and function. We then highlight recent findings that advance these concepts and conclude with a consideration of open questions that represent some of the major hurdles to be addressed in the future.","Christopher D Balak, Claudia Z Han, Christopher K Glass",Current opinion in genetics & development,2024,N/A,10.1016/j.gde.2023.102146,"Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of California, San Diego, USA; Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program, University of California, San Diego, USA.; Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of California, San Diego, USA.; Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of California, San Diego, USA; Department of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, USA.

Breastfeeding is recognized as the best practice of infant nutrition in comparison with formula feeding. We evaluated the effects of the primary feeding practices by analyzing the infant growth and the potential association with gut diseases. A cross-sectional and observational study was designed. This study included 55 mothers with infants, who were divided according to their feeding practices in breastfeeding (BF), formula feeding (FF), and combined breast and formula feeding (CF). Anthropometric measurements of the participants were recorded. Additionally, non-invasive fecal samples from the infants were collected to analyze the microbiota by sequencing, immunoglobulin A (IgA) concentration (ELISA), and volatile organic compounds (gas chromatography with an electronic nose). Results showed that the microbiota diversity in the BF group was the highest compared to the other two groups. The IgA levels in the BF group were twice as high as those in the FF group. Moreover, the child´s growth in the BF group showed the best infant development when the data were compared at birth to the recollection time, as noted by the correlation with a decreased concentration of toxic volatile organic compounds. Interestingly, the CF group showed a significant difference in health status when the data were compared with the FF group. We conclude that early health practices influence children's growth, which is relevant to further research about how those infants' health evolved.","Misael Martínez-Martínez, Marco Martínez-Martínez, Ruth Soria-Guerra, Sandra Gamiño-Gutiérrez, Carolina Senés-Guerrero, Arlette Santacruz, Rogelio Flores-Ramírez, Abel Salazar-Martínez, Diana Portales-Pérez, Horacio Bach, Fidel Martínez-Gutiérrez",PloS one,2024,N/A,10.1371/journal.pone.0294494,"Facultad de Ciencias Quimicas, Universidad Autonoma de San Luis Potosí, SLP, Mexico.; Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Torreón, Mexico.; Facultad de Ciencias Quimicas, Universidad Autonoma de San Luis Potosí, SLP, Mexico.; Facultad de Ciencias Quimicas, Universidad Autonoma de San Luis Potosí, SLP, Mexico.; Tecnológico de Monterrey, Campus Guadalajara, Zapopan, Jalisco, Mexico.; Posgrado en Biotecnología, Centro de Biotecnología FEMSA, Tecnológico de Monterrey, Monterrey, Mexico.; Laboratorio de Salud Total, Centro de Investigación Aplicada en Ambiente y Salud -CIACYT, Universidad Autónoma de San Luis Potosí, SLP, Mexico.; Hospital Central ""Dr. Ignacio Morones Prieto"", San Luis Potosí, SLP, Mexico.; Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Torreón, Mexico.; Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.; Facultad de Ciencias Quimicas, Universidad Autonoma de San Luis Potosí, SLP, Mexico.","Infant, Newborn; Infant; Female; Child; Humans; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Cross-Sectional Studies; Volatile Organic Compounds; Breast Feeding; Immunoglobulin A; Infant Formula",N/A,Observational Study; Journal Article
38170702,3D Mitochondrial Structure in Aging Human Skeletal Muscle: Insights into MFN-2 Mediated Changes.,"Age-related atrophy of skeletal muscle, is characterized by loss of mass, strength, endurance, and oxidative capacity during aging. Notably, bioenergetics and protein turnover studies have shown that mitochondria mediate this decline in function. Although exercise has been the only therapy to mitigate sarcopenia, the mechanisms that govern how exercise serves to promote healthy muscle aging are unclear. Mitochondrial aging is associated with decreased mitochondrial capacity, so we sought to investigate how aging affects mitochondrial structure and potential age-related regulators. Specifically, the three-dimensional (3D) mitochondrial structure associated with morphological changes in skeletal muscle during aging requires further elucidation. We hypothesized that aging causes structural remodeling of mitochondrial 3D architecture representative of dysfunction, and this effect is mitigated by exercise. We used serial block-face scanning electron microscopy to image human skeletal tissue samples, followed by manual contour tracing using Amira software for 3D reconstruction and subsequent analysis of mitochondria.

38165516,"Vaccination against influenza viruses reduces infection, not hospitalization or death, from respiratory COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes COVID-19 and has brought a huge burden in terms of human lives. Strict social distance and influenza vaccination have been recommended to avoid co-infections between influenza viruses and SARS-CoV-2. Scattered reports suggested a protective effect of influenza vaccine on COVID-19 development and severity. We analyzed 51 studies on the capacity of influenza vaccination to affect infection with SARS-CoV-2, hospitalization, admission to Intensive Care Units (ICU), and mortality. All subjects taken into consideration did not receive any anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, although their status with respect to previous infections with SARS-CoV-2 is not known. Comparison between vaccinated and not-vaccinated subjects for each of the four endpoints was expressed as odds ratio (OR), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs); all analyses were performed by DerSimonian and Laird model, and Hartung-Knapp model when studies were less than 10. In a total of 61 029 936 subjects from 33 studies, influenza vaccination reduced frequency of SARS-CoV-2 infection [OR plus 95% CI = 0.70 (0.65-0.77)]. The effect was significant in all studies together, in health care workers and in the general population; distance from influenza vaccination and the type of vaccine were also of importance. In 98 174 subjects from 11 studies, frequency of ICU admission was reduced with influenza vaccination [OR (95% CI) = 0.71 (0.54-0.94)]; the effect was significant in all studies together, in pregnant women and in hospitalized subjects. In contrast, in 4 737 328 subjects from 14 studies hospitalization was not modified [OR (95% CI) = 1.05 (0.82-1.35)], and in 4 139 660 subjects from 19 studies, mortality was not modified [OR (95% CI) = 0.76 (0.26-2.20)].

Furthermore, respiratory diseases are commonly observed in these mammals. Nevertheless, much of their respiratory physiology remains unknown due to the limited supply and poor quality of their biological samples for research. In this study, we established a novel lung cell line, dLu, derived from the common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), which can prove useful in cetacean research, including for understanding the pathogenesis of respiratory diseases in cetaceans. The cells were cultured in a simple medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The morphology of the cells was fibroblast-like. dLu was produced by transfecting the simian virus 40 large T antigen into primary cultured cells. Although dLu exhibited approximately 80 cell divisions, it was unable to achieve complete immortalization, as the cells stopped proliferating beyond this number. dLu cells expressed toll-like receptor 3 but not toll-like receptor 4. Immunostimulation with poly(I:C) altered the gene expressions of interferon beta 1 and tumor necrosis factor alpha in dLu cells. In summary, dLu established in this study is a novel cetacean cell resource that can be easily cultured and is a useful in vitro tool in cetacean research, particularly for studying host immune responses in the lungs.","Kaede Tashiro, Kyosuke Hikobe, Takao Segawa, Miwa Suzuki, Ken Maeda, Takuya Itou",In vitro cellular & developmental biology.

38148353,"The yeast-human coevolution: Fungal transition from passengers, colonizers, and invaders.","Fungi are the cause of more than a billion infections in humans every year, although their interactions with the host are still neglected compared to bacteria. Major systemic fungal infections are very unusual in the healthy population, due to the long history of coevolution with the human host. Humans are routinely exposed to environmental fungi and can host a commensal mycobiota, which is increasingly considered as a key player in health and disease. Here, we review the current knowledge on host-fungi coevolution and the factors that regulate their interaction. On one hand, fungi have learned to survive and inhabit the host organisms as a natural ecosystem, on the other hand, the host immune system finely tunes the response toward fungi. In turn, recognition of fungi as commensals or pathogens regulates the host immune balance in health and disease. In the human gut ecosystem, yeasts provide a fingerprint of the transient microbiota. Their status as passengers or colonizers is related to the integrity of the gut barrier and the risk of multiple disorders. Thus, the study of this less known component of the microbiota could unravel the rules of the transition from passengers to colonizers and invaders, as well as their dependence on the innate component of the host's immune response.

SCFAs, including butyrate, acetate, and propionate, are absorbed in the colon or excreted through feces, contributing to essential physiological processes. Butyrate, a primary energy source for colonocytes, exhibits anti-inflammatory properties and regulates key pathways, such as nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) inhibition. SCFAs' impact extends beyond the intestines, influencing the gut-brain axis, systemic circulation, and folate metabolism. A decline in colonic SCFAs has been linked to gastrointestinal diseases, emphasizing their clinical relevance, while their effects on immune checkpoints, such as ipilimumab, provide intriguing prospects for cancer therapy.

These methods can be used both in health and in states of inflammation, such as periodontitis. The optimized protocols use different enzymatic approaches (collagenase II, collagenase IV and the Miltenyi whole skin dissociation kit) and yield preferential recovery of immune, stromal and epithelial cells, respectively.

38142927,Fragrances as a trigger of immune responses in different environments.,"Fragrances can cause allergic skin reactions, expressed as allergic contact dermatitis and reactions in the respiratory tract that range from acute temporary upper airway irritation to obstructive lung disease. These adverse health effects may result from the stimulation of a specific (adaptive) immune response. Th1 cells, which essentially produce interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ), play a key role in allergic contact dermatitis and also on allergic sensitization to common allergens (e.g., nickel and fragrance). It has been shown that fragrance allergy leads to Th2/Th22 production of IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13, controlling the development of IgE and mediating hypersensitivity reactions in the lung, such as asthma. Cytokines released during immune response modulate the expression of cytochrome P450 (CYPs) proteins, which can result in alterations of the pharmacological effects of substances in inflammatory diseases. The mechanisms linking environment and immunity are still not completely understood but it is known that aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a sensor with conserved ligand-activated transcription factor, highly expressed in cells that controls complex transcriptional programs which are ligand and cell type specific, with CYPs as targeted genes. This review focuses on these important aspects of immune responses of the skin and respiratory tract cells, describing some in vitro models applied to evaluate the mechanisms involved in fragrance-induced allergy.","M Macchione, K Yoshizaki, D P Frias, K Maier, J Smelan, C M Prado, T Mauad",Toxicology in vitro : an international journal published in association with BIBRA,2024,Allergic reactions; CYP enzymes; Fragrance; Inflammation; Respiratory sensitization; T helper cell,10.1016/j.tiv.2023.105769,"Laboratory of Experimental Environmental Pathology, Department of Pathology, Sao Paulo University Medical School, Sao Paulo, Brazil.

However, with the emergence of highly contagious strains, such as the Omicron variant, it was necessary to know the serological status of health personnel to make decisions for the application of reinforcements. The aim of this work was to determine the seroprevalence against SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare workers in a Mexican hospital after six months of the administration of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine (two doses, 4 weeks apart) and to investigate the association between comorbidities, response to the vaccine, and reinfections. Neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were determined using ELISA assays for 262 employees of Hospital Juárez de México with and without a history of COVID-19. A beta regression analysis was performed to study the associated comorbidities and their relationship with the levels of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Finally, an epidemiological follow-up was carried out to detect reinfections in this population. A significant difference in SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was observed in workers with a history of COVID-19 prior to vaccination compared to those without a history of the disease (MD: 0.961 and SD: 0.049; <0.001). Beta regression showed that workers with a history of COVID-19 have greater protection compared to those without a history of the infection. Neutralizing antibodies were found to be decreased in alcoholic and diabetic subjects (80.1%). Notably, eight cases of Omicron reinfections were identified, and gender and obesity were associated with the presence of reinfections (6.41 OR; 95% BCa CI: 1.15, 105.0). The response to the vaccine was influenced by the history of SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated comorbidities. The above highlights the importance of prioritizing this segment of the population for reinforcements in periods of less than one year to guarantee their effectiveness against new variants.","Cruz Vargas-De-León, Mónica Alethia Cureño-Díaz, Ma Isabel Salazar, Clemente Cruz-Cruz, Miguel Ángel Loyola-Cruz, Emilio Mariano Durán-Manuel, Edwin Rodrigo Zamora-Pacheco, Juan Carlos Bravata-Alcántara, Gustavo Esteban Lugo-Zamudio, Verónica Fernández-Sánchez, Juan Manuel Bello-López, Gabriela Ibáñez-Cervantes",Viruses,2023,COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; healthcare workers; neutralizing antibodies; reinfections; vaccination,10.3390/v15122354,"División de Investigación, Hospital Juárez de México, Ciudad de México 07760, Mexico.; Dirección de Investigación y Enseñanza, Hospital Juárez de México, Ciudad de México 07760, Mexico.; Laboratorio Nacional de Vacunología y Virus Tropicales, Escuela Nacional de Ciencias Biológicas (ENCB), Instituto Politécnico Nacional, Ciudad de México 11340, México.; División de Investigación, Hospital Juárez de México, Ciudad de México 07760, Mexico.; División de Investigación, Hospital Juárez de México, Ciudad de México 07760, Mexico.; División de Investigación, Hospital Juárez de México, Ciudad de México 07760, Mexico.; Laboratorio de Modelación Bioestadística para la Salud, Sección de Estudios de Posgrado e Investigación, Escuela Superior de Medicina, Instituto Politécnico Nacional, Ciudad de México 07738, Mexico.; Laboratorio de Diagnóstico Molecular, Hospital Juárez de México, Ciudad de México 07760, Mexico.; Dirección General, Hospital Juárez de México, Ciudad de México 07760, Mexico.; División de Investigación, Hospital Juárez de México, Ciudad de México 07760, Mexico.; División de Investigación, Hospital Juárez de México, Ciudad de México 07760, Mexico.; División de Investigación, Hospital Juárez de México, Ciudad de México 07760, Mexico.","Humans; SARS-CoV-2; Antibodies, Neutralizing; COVID-19; Reinfection; Seroepidemiologic Studies; Health Personnel; Vaccines; Antibodies, Viral; Vaccination",N/A,Journal Article

The CAPTURA consortium, funded by the Fleming Fund, was implemented across 7 countries in the South and Southeast Asian region. The program focused on collating historical bacteriological data for qualitative and quantitative analyses. The team gathered standard data on the quality of laboratories and clinics and the quality and quantity of retrospective historical AMR data. In addition, retrospective data on antimicrobial use and consumption were analyzed. While standard protocols guided the project, a tailored approach for stakeholder engagement was implemented to work with countries and secure data-sharing agreements. The program also had to navigate the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, making some innovative adaptations to overcome logistical barriers.

Macrophage colony-stimulating factor (CSF1)-dependent macrophages contribute to homeostatic control of the size of the liver. This study aimed to determine the systemic metabolic consequences of elevating circulating CSF1. Acute administration of a CSF1-Fc fusion protein to mice led to monocytosis, increased resident tissue macrophages in the liver and all major organs, and liver growth. These effects were associated with increased hepatic glucose uptake and extensive mobilization of body fat. The impacts of CSF1 on macrophage abundance, liver size, and body composition were rapidly reversed to restore homeostasis. The effects of CSF1 on metabolism were independent of several known endocrine regulators and did not impact the physiological fasting response. Analysis using implantable telemetry in metabolic cages revealed progressively reduced body temperature and physical activity with no change in diurnal food intake. These results demonstrate the existence of a dynamic equilibrium between CSF1, the mononuclear phagocyte system, and control of liver-to-body weight ratio, which in turn controls systemic metabolic homeostasis. This novel macrophage regulatory axis has the potential to promote fat mobilization, without changes in appetence, which may have novel implications for managing metabolic syndrome.","Sahar Keshvari, Jesse J R Masson, Michelle Ferrari-Cestari, Liviu-Gabriel Bodea, Fathima Nooru-Mohamed, Brian W C Tse, Kamil A Sokolowski, Lena Batoon, Omkar L Patkar, Mitchell A Sullivan, Hilmar Ebersbach, Cian Stutz, Robert G Parton, Kim M Summers, Allison R Pettit, David A Hume, Katharine M Irvine",American journal of physiology.

Rural areas tend to have higher rates of cancer-related morbidity and mortality as well as higher rates of cancer-risk factors among adolescents. Rural primary care clinicians are well-positioned to address these risk factors. Our goal was to identify existing literature on adolescent cancer prevention in rural primary care and to classify key barriers and facilitators to implementing interventions in such settings. We searched the following databases: Ovid MEDLINE®; Ovid APA PsycInfo; Cochrane Library; CINAHL; and Scopus. Studies were included if they reported on provider and/or clinic-level interventions in rural primary care clinics addressing one of these four behaviors (obesity, tobacco, sun exposure, HPV vaccination) among adolescent populations. We identified 3,403 unique studies and 24 met inclusion criteria for this review. 16 addressed obesity, 6 addressed HPV vaccination, 1 addressed skin cancer, and 1 addressed multiple behaviors including obesity and tobacco use. 10 studies were either non-randomized experimental designs (n = 8) or randomized controlled trials (n = 2). The remaining were observational or descriptive research. We found a dearth of studies addressing implementation of adolescent cancer prevention interventions in rural primary care settings.

38113758,Human gut microbiota and endocrinology: paradigm shift from genome to its regulation.,"Over the last two decades, it has become clear that the human gut microbiota, a complex community of bacteria, archaea, fungi and viruses, are a critical determinant of human health and disease. Microbiota-derived metabolites provide the host with energy, protect against pathogens, modulate immune and endocrine systems as well as the level of reactive oxygen species in the gut. It has come with no surprise that the human gut microbiota is also linked to the production, utilisation and regulation of host hormones. This implies that the gut microbiota is capable of influencing human behaviour, appetite regulation and metabolism as well as development and immunity. Many of the advances in the field of crosstalk between the gut microbiota and host health, disease and behaviours are generally based on DNA analyses of microbial populations and transplantation of monocultured commensal species to germ-free animals. Recent reports on the activity of the gut microbiota in gastrointestinal diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer have highlighted two important points. First, microbial DNA-based abundance does not always correlate with their level of activity and secondly, that metabolism of the complex gut microbiota is regulated by host health status, including the production and metabolism of several human hormones. In this review, we will discuss the lessons learnt from studying the activity and metabolism of the human gut microbiota in health and across gastrointestinal diseases, and how these findings can shape future research on the microbiome-gut-endocrine axis.","Matthew T F Lamaudière, Mark C Turner, Ramesh P Arasaradnam, Igor Y Morozov",The Journal of endocrinology,2024,active gut microbiota; behaviour; colorectal cancer; neurotransmitters; transcriptomics,10.1530/JOE-23-0348,"Centre for Health & Life Sciences, Coventry University, Coventry, UK.; Centre for Health & Life Sciences, Coventry University, Coventry, UK.; Divison of Biomedical Sciences, Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick, Warwick, UK.; Centre for Health & Life Sciences, Coventry University, Coventry, UK.",Animals; Humans; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Endocrine System; Hormones; Gastrointestinal Diseases; DNA,N/A,Journal Article; Review
38113381,"Public perceptions of Ebola vaccines and confidence in health services to treat Ebola, malaria, and tuberculosis: Findings from a cross-sectional household survey in Uganda, 2020.","Uganda used Ebola vaccines as part of its preparedness and response during the 2018-2020 10th Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in neighboring Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). We evaluated the public's perceptions of Ebola vaccines and compared their confidence in health services to treat Ebola versus malaria and tuberculosis as part of a survey on Ebola knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) conducted in March 2020. A cross-sectional household survey was implemented in six districts in Uganda using multi-stage cluster sampling to randomly select participants. The districts were purposively selected from districts classified by the government as at high- or low-risk for an EVD outbreak. We describe perceptions of Ebola vaccines and confidence in health services to treat Ebola, tuberculosis, and malaria. Modified Poisson regression modeling was used to identify the demographic correlates of these outcomes. Among 3,485 respondents, 18% were aware of Ebola vaccines. Of those, 92% agreed that the vaccines were needed to prevent Ebola. Participants aged 15-24 years were 4% more likely to perceive such need compared to those 60 years and older (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR] 1.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0-1.08). The perceived need was 5% lower among participants with at least some secondary education compared to uneducated participants (aPR 0.95; 0.92-0.99). Overall, 81% of those aware of the vaccines believed that everyone or most people in their community would get vaccinated if offered, and 94% said they would likely get vaccinated if offered. Confidence in health services to treat Ebola was lower compared to treating malaria or tuberculosis (55% versus 93% and 77%, respectively). However, participants from the EVD high-risk districts were 22% more likely to be confident in health services to treat Ebola compared to those in low-risk districts (aPR: 1.22; 95% CI: 1.08, 1.38). Our findings suggest that intent to take an Ebola vaccine during an outbreak was strong, but more work needs to be done to increase public awareness of these vaccines.

Developing an eHealth Intervention to Increase COVID-19 Testing and Vaccination Literacy Among Women with Criminal and Legal System Involvement.","Many women leaving jails are ill-prepared to follow recommended COVID-19 mitigation practices, including testing and vaccination. Low COVID-19-related health literacy, exposure to disinformation, and mistrust in authorities put women at increased risk. Research on this population has shown significant use of mobile devices for communication and web access and public Wi-fi for the internet. Using inductive (formative empirical research with the community) and deductive (theory-based) practices, we designed, developed, and pilot-tested a multimedia, culturally tailored web-based electronic health (eHealth) application to increase COVID-19-specific health literacy and promote testing and vaccination among women with criminal and legal system involvement (CLSI). The intervention included a serialized animated multimedia component and a telenovela-style series, complementing each other and addressing knowledge needs identified in the formative research phase of the project. The eHealth intervention was pilot-tested with 13 CLSI women by using online activity logs and semi-structured telephone interviews. Findings confirmed that eHealth interventions employing multimodal information delivery had increased chances of engaging audiences, especially when developed with input from the target population and are culturally tailored. In addition, using a web-based delivery optimized for mobile made the intervention accessible on various devices and decreased the risk of technical problems.","Mugur V Geana, Pan Liu, Jun Pei, Sherri Anderson, Megha Ramaswamy",Journal of health communication,2024,N/A,10.1080/10810730.2023.2293094,"Center for Excellence in Health Communication to Underserved Populations, School of Journalism and Mass Communications, University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas, USA.; Department of Media, Design, and Communication, Marian University, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.; Center for Excellence in Health Communication to Underserved Populations, School of Journalism and Mass Communications, University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas, USA.; Department of Population Health, University of Kansas School of Medicine, Kansas City, Kansas, USA.; Department of Population Health, University of Kansas School of Medicine, Kansas City, Kansas, USA.",Humans; Female; COVID-19 Testing; Criminals; COVID-19; Communication; Health Literacy; Internet; Telemedicine,U01 MD017415 (NIMHD NIH HHS),"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"
38111197,Roles of NS1 Protein in Flavivirus Pathogenesis.,"Flaviviruses such as dengue, Zika, and West Nile viruses are highly concerning pathogens that pose significant risks to public health. The NS1 protein is conserved among flaviviruses and is synthesized as a part of the flavivirus polyprotein. It plays a critical role in viral replication, disease progression, and immune evasion. Post-translational modifications influence NS1's stability, secretion, antigenicity, and interactions with host factors. NS1 protein forms extensive interactions with host cellular proteins allowing it to affect vital processes such as RNA processing, gene expression regulation, and cellular homeostasis, which in turn influence viral replication, disease pathogenesis, and immune responses. NS1 acts as an immune evasion factor by delaying complement-dependent lysis of infected cells and contributes to disease pathogenesis by inducing endothelial cell damage and vascular leakage and triggering autoimmune responses. Anti-NS1 antibodies have been shown to cross-react with host endothelial cells and platelets, causing autoimmune destruction that is hypothesized to contribute to disease pathogenesis. However, in contrast, immunization of animal models with the NS1 protein confers protection against lethal challenges from flaviviruses such as dengue and Zika viruses. Understanding the multifaceted roles of NS1 in flavivirus pathogenesis is crucial for effective disease management and control. Therefore, further research into NS1 biology, including its host protein interactions and additional roles in disease pathology, is imperative for the development of strategies and therapeutics to combat flavivirus infections successfully. This Review provides an in-depth exploration of the current available knowledge on the multifaceted roles of the NS1 protein in the pathogenesis of flaviviruses.","Dayangi R Perera, Nadeeka D Ranadeva, Kavish Sirisena, Kaveesha J Wijesinghe",ACS infectious diseases,2024,Flaviviruses; NS1 protein; NS1 structure; endothelial hyperpermeability; flavivirus pathogenesis; immune evasion; post-translational modifications; viral replication,10.1021/acsinfecdis.3c00566,"Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Colombo, Sri Lanka 00300.; Department of Biomedical Science, Faculty of Health Sciences, KIU Campus Sri Lanka 10120.; Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Colombo, Sri Lanka 00300.; Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Colombo, Sri Lanka 00300.",Animals; Flavivirus; Endothelial Cells; Flavivirus Infections; Zika Virus; Zika Virus Infection; Dengue,N/A,"Journal Article; Review; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"
38110348,Real-Time High Throughput Technique to Quantify Neutrophil Extracellular Traps Formation in Human Neutrophils.,"Neutrophils are myeloid-lineage cells that form a crucial part of the innate immune system. The past decade has revealed additional key roles that neutrophils play in the pathogenesis of cancer, autoimmune diseases, and various acute and chronic inflammatory conditions by contributing to the initiation and perpetuation of immune dysregulation through multiple mechanisms, including the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which are structures crucial in antimicrobial defense. Limitations in techniques to quantify NET formation in an unbiased, reproducible, and efficient way have restricted our ability to further understand the role of neutrophils in health and diseases. We describe an automated, real-time, high-throughput method to quantify neutrophils undergoing NET formation using a live cell imaging platform coupled with a membrane permeability-dependent dual-dye approach using two different DNA dyes to image intracellular and extracellular DNA. This methodology is able to help assess neutrophil physiology and test molecules that can target NET formation.","Shuichiro Nakabo, Mariana J Kaplan, Sarthak Gupta",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2023,N/A,10.3791/66051,"Systemic Autoimmunity Branch, National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS), National Institutes of Health (NIH).; Systemic Autoimmunity Branch, National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS), National Institutes of Health (NIH).; Systemic Autoimmunity Branch, National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS), National Institutes of Health (NIH); sarthak.gupta@nih.gov.",Humans; Neutrophils; Extracellular Traps; Autoimmune Diseases; Cell Membrane Permeability; Coloring Agents; DNA,N/A,Journal Article; Video-Audio Media

Consequently, intracellular cholesterol concentrations are tightly regulated by complex processes, including cholesterol synthesis, uptake from circulating lipoproteins, lipid transfer to these lipoproteins, esterification, and metabolization into oxysterols that are intermediates for bile acids. Oxysterols have been considered for long time as sterol waste products, but a large body of evidence has clearly demonstrated that they play key roles in central nervous system functioning, immune cell response, cell death, or migration and are involved in age-related diseases, cancers, autoimmunity, or neurological disorders. Among all the existing oxysterols, this review summarizes basic as well as recent knowledge on 25-hydroxycholesterol which is mainly produced during inflammatory or infectious situations and that in turn contributes to immune response, central nervous system disorders, atherosclerosis, macular degeneration, or cancer development.

38078340,Defining solute carrier transporter signatures of murine immune cell subsets.,"Solute carrier (SLC) transporters are membrane-bound proteins that facilitate nutrient transport, and the movement across cellular membranes of various substrates ranging from ions to amino acids, metabolites and drugs. Recently, SLCs have gained increased attention due to their functional linkage to innate immunological processes such as the clearance of dead cells and anti-microbial defense. Further, the druggable nature of these transporters provides unique opportunities for improving outcomes in different immunological diseases. Although the SLCs represent the largest group of transporters and are often identified as significant hits in omics data sets, their role in immunology has been insufficiently explored. This is partly due to the absence of tools that allow identification of SLC expression in particular immune cell types and enable their comparison before embarking on functional studies. In this study, we used publicly available RNA-Seq data sets to analyze the transcriptome in adaptive and innate immune cells, focusing on differentially and highly expressed SLCs. This revealed several new insights: first, we identify differentially expressed SLC transcripts in phagocytes (macrophages, dendritic cells, and neutrophils) compared to adaptive immune cells; second, we identify new potential immune cell markers based on SLC expression; and third, we provide user-friendly online tools for researchers to explore SLC genes of interest (and the rest of the genes as well), in three-way comparative dot plots among immune cells.

38077369,Chronic metabolic stress drives developmental programs and loss of tissue functions in non-transformed liver that mirror tumor states and stratify survival.,"Under chronic stress, cells must balance competing demands between cellular survival and tissue function. In metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD, formerly NAFLD/NASH), hepatocytes cooperate with structural and immune cells to perform crucial metabolic, synthetic, and detoxification functions despite nutrient imbalances. While prior work has emphasized stress-induced drivers of cell death, the dynamic adaptations of surviving cells and their functional repercussions remain unclear. Namely, we do not know which pathways and programs define cellular responses, what regulatory factors mediate (mal)adaptations, and how this aberrant activity connects to tissue-scale dysfunction and long-term disease outcomes. Here, by applying longitudinal single-cell multi -omics to a mouse model of chronic metabolic stress and extending to human cohorts, we show that stress drives survival-linked tradeoffs and metabolic rewiring, manifesting as shifts towards development-associated states in non-transformed hepatocytes with accompanying decreases in their professional functionality. Diet-induced adaptations occur significantly prior to tumorigenesis but parallel tumorigenesis-induced phenotypes and predict worsened human cancer survival.

The oral cavity is one of the most important interaction windows between the human body and the environment, allowing the entry of an important number of microorganisms and their passage across the gastrointestinal tract and lungs. In this review, the contribution of the microbiome network to the establishment of systemic diseases like cancer is analyzed through their synergistic interactions and bidirectional crosstalk in the oral-gut-lung axis as well as its communication with the host cells. Moreover, the impact of the characteristic microbiota of each population in the formation of the multiomics molecular metafirm of the oral-gut-lung axis is also analyzed through state-of-the-art sequencing techniques, which allow a global study of the molecular processes involved of the flow of the microbiota environmental signals through cancer-related cells and its relationship with the establishment of the transcription factor network responsible for the control of regulatory processes involved with tumorigenesis.","Beatriz Andrea Otálora-Otálora, Juan Javier López-Rivera, Claudia Aristizábal-Guzmán, Mario Arturo Isaza-Ruget, Carlos Arturo Álvarez-Moreno",International journal of molecular sciences,2023,adaptive and innate immune receptors; cancer; epigenomics; genomics; host–microbiome crosstalk; oral-gut-lung axis; transcriptional regulatory network (TRN); transcriptomics,10.3390/ijms242316638,"Grupo de Investigación INPAC, Unidad de Investigación, Fundación Universitaria Sanitas, Bogotá 110131, Colombia.; Grupo de Investigación INPAC, Specialized Laboratory, Clinica Universitaria Colombia, Clínica Colsanitas S.A., Bogotá 111321, Colombia.; Grupo de Investigación INPAC, Unidad de Investigación, Fundación Universitaria Sanitas, Bogotá 110131, Colombia.; Keralty, Sanitas International Organization, Grupo de Investigación INPAC, Fundación Universitaria Sanitas, Bogotá 110131, Colombia.; Infectious Diseases Department, Clinica Universitaria Colombia, Clínica Colsanitas S.A., Bogotá 111321, Colombia.","Humans; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Multiomics; Microbiota; Neoplasms; Receptors, Immunologic; Lung; Genes, Regulator",N/A,Journal Article; Review

38067380,Galectins in Protozoan Parasitic Diseases: Potential Applications in Diagnostics and Therapeutics.,"Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) constitute a group of diseases that generally develop in tropical or subtropical climatic conditions and are related to poverty. Within the spectrum of NTDs, diseases caused by protozoa such as malaria, Chagas disease, and leishmaniasis exhibit elevated mortality rates, thereby constituting a substantial public health concern. Beyond their protozoan etiology, these NTDs share other similarities, such as the challenge of control and the lack of affordable, safe, and effective drugs. In view of the above, the need to explore novel diagnostic predictors and therapeutic targets for the treatment of these parasitic diseases is evident. In this context, galectins are attractive because they are a set of lectins bound to β-galactosides that play key roles in a variety of cellular processes, including host-parasite interaction such as adhesion and entry of parasites into the host cells, and participate in antiparasitic immunity in either a stimulatory or inhibitory manner, especially the galectins-1, -2, -3, and -9. These functions bestow upon galectins significant therapeutic prospects in the context of managing and diagnosing NTDs. Thus, the present review aims to elucidate the potential role of galectins in the diagnosis and treatment of malaria, leishmaniasis, and Chagas disease.","Cássio Meira, Jaqueline Silva, Helenita Quadros, Laís Silva, Breno Barreto, Vinícius Rocha, Larissa Bomfim, Emanuelle Santos, Milena Soares",Cells,2023,Chagas disease; galectins; leishmaniasis; malaria,10.3390/cells12232671,"Gonçalo Moniz Institute, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (FIOCRUZ), Salvador 21040-900, Bahia, Brazil.; Gonçalo Moniz Institute, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (FIOCRUZ), Salvador 21040-900, Bahia, Brazil.; Gonçalo Moniz Institute, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (FIOCRUZ), Salvador 21040-900, Bahia, Brazil.; Gonçalo Moniz Institute, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (FIOCRUZ), Salvador 21040-900, Bahia, Brazil.; Gonçalo Moniz Institute, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (FIOCRUZ), Salvador 21040-900, Bahia, Brazil.; Gonçalo Moniz Institute, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (FIOCRUZ), Salvador 21040-900, Bahia, Brazil.; Gonçalo Moniz Institute, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (FIOCRUZ), Salvador 21040-900, Bahia, Brazil.; SENAI Institute of Innovation in Health Advanced Systems (ISI SAS), University Center SENAI/CIMATEC, Salvador 41650-010, Bahia, Brazil.; Gonçalo Moniz Institute, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (FIOCRUZ), Salvador 21040-900, Bahia, Brazil.",Animals; Parasites; Galectins; Parasitic Diseases; Leishmaniasis; Chagas Disease; Malaria,0002/2014 (Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado da Bahia),"Journal Article; Review; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"
38067100,The microbiome: an integral player in immune homeostasis and inflammation in the respiratory tract.,"The last decade of microbiome research has highlighted its fundamental role in systemic immune and metabolic homeostasis. The microbiome plays a prominent role during gestation and into early life, when maternal lifestyle factors shape immune development of the newborn. Breast milk further shapes gut colonization, supporting the development of tolerance to commensal bacteria and harmless antigens while preventing outgrowth of pathogens. Environmental microbial and lifestyle factors that disrupt this process can dysregulate immune homeostasis, predisposing infants to atopic disease and childhood asthma. In health, the low-biomass lung microbiome, together with inhaled environmental microbial constituents, establishes the immunological set point that is necessary to maintain pulmonary immune defense. However, in disease perturbations to immunological and physiological processes allow the upper respiratory tract to act as a reservoir of pathogenic bacteria, which can colonize the diseased lung and cause severe inflammation. Studying these host-microbe interactions in respiratory diseases holds great promise to stratify patients for suitable treatment regimens and biomarker discovery to predict disease progression. Preclinical studies show that commensal gut microbes are in a constant flux of cell division and death, releasing microbial constituents, metabolic by-products, and vesicles that shape the immune system and can protect against respiratory diseases. The next major advances may come from testing and utilizing these microbial factors for clinical benefit and exploiting the predictive power of the microbiome by employing multiomics analysis approaches.","Olaf Perdijk, Rossana Azzoni, Benjamin J Marsland",Physiological reviews,2024,gut-lung axis; microbial metabolites; microbiome,10.1152/physrev.00020.2023,"Department of Immunology, School of Translational Science, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.; Department of Immunology, School of Translational Science, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.; Department of Immunology, School of Translational Science, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.","Infant, Newborn; Humans; Child; Lung; Microbiota; Asthma; Inflammation; Bacteria; Homeostasis",1154344 (DHAC | National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)),Journal Article; Review
38059886,Microfluidic-Based Reconstitution of Functional Lymphatic Microvasculature: Elucidating the Role of Lymphatics in Health and Disease.,"The knowledge of the blood microvasculature and its functional role in health and disease has grown significantly attributable to decades of research and numerous advances in cell biology and tissue engineering; however, the lymphatics (the secondary vascular system) has not garnered similar attention, in part due to a lack of relevant in vitro models that mimic its pathophysiological functions. Here, a microfluidic-based approach is adopted to achieve precise control over the biological transport of growth factors and interstitial flow that drive the in vivo growth of lymphatic capillaries (lymphangiogenesis). The engineered on-chip lymphatics with in vivo-like morphology exhibit tissue-scale functionality with drainage rates of interstitial proteins and molecules comparable to in vivo standards. Computational and scaling analyses of the underlying transport phenomena elucidate the critical role of the three-dimensional geometry and lymphatic endothelium in recapitulating physiological drainage. Finally, the engineered on-chip lymphatics enabled studies of lymphatic-immune interactions that revealed inflammation-driven responses by the lymphatics to recruit immune cells via chemotactic signals similar to in vivo, pathological events. This on-chip lymphatics platform permits the interrogation of various lymphatic biological functions, as well as screening of lymphatic-based therapies such as interstitial absorption of protein therapeutics and lymphatic immunomodulation for cancer therapy.","Jean C Serrano, Mark R Gillrie, Ran Li, Sarah H Ishamuddin, Emad Moeendarbary, Roger D Kamm","Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)",2024,immune cells; lymphatics; microfluidics; tissue engineering; transport phenomena,10.1002/advs.202302903,"Department of Mechanical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA.; Department of Biological Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA.; Center for Systems Biology Massachusetts General Hospital Research Institute, Boston, MA, 02114, USA.; Department of Biological Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA.; Department of Biological Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA.; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA.",Humans; Microfluidics; Lymphatic Vessels; Lymphangiogenesis; Microvessels; Inflammation,R01 NS121078 (NINDS NIH HHS); U01 CA214381 (NCI NIH HHS); U01CA214381 (NCI NIH HHS); BB/V001418/1 (Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council),"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

This first-in-human trial investigates the safety and tolerability of Clever-1 blockade with bexmarilimab in patients with treatment-refractory solid tumors and assesses preliminary anti-tumor efficacy, pharmacodynamics, and immunologic correlates. Bexmarilimab shows no dose-limiting toxicities in part I (n = 30) and no additional safety signals in part II (n = 108). Disease control (DC) rates of 25%-40% are observed in cutaneous melanoma, gastric, hepatocellular, estrogen receptor-positive breast, and biliary tract cancers. DC associates with improved survival in a landmark analysis and correlates with high pre-treatment intratumoral Clever-1 positivity and increasing on-treatment serum interferon γ (IFNγ) levels. Spatial transcriptomics profiling of DC and non-DC tumors demonstrates bexmarilimab-induced macrophage activation and stimulation of IFNγ and T cell receptor signaling selectively in DC patients. These data suggest that bexmarilimab therapy is well tolerated and show that macrophage targeting can promote immune activation and tumor control in late-stage cancer.","Jenna H Rannikko, Loic Verlingue, Maria de Miguel, Annika Pasanen, Debbie Robbrecht, Tanja Skytta, Sanna Iivanainen, Shishir Shetty, Yuk Ting Ma, Donna M Graham, Sukeshi Patel Arora, Panu Jaakkola, Christina Yap, Yujuan Xiang, Jami Mandelin, Matti K Karvonen, Juho Jalkanen, Sinem Karaman, Jussi P Koivunen, Anna Minchom, Maija Hollmén, Petri Bono",Cell reports.

38055196,Meningococcal Disease in the Post-COVID-19 Era: A Time to Prepare.,"The global invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) landscape changed considerably during the COVID-19 pandemic, as evidenced by decreased incidence rates due to COVID-19 mitigation measures, such as limited social contact, physical distancing, mask wearing, and hand washing. Vaccination rates were also lower during the pandemic relative to pre-pandemic levels. Although policymakers may have shifted their focus away from IMD vaccination programs to COVID-19 vaccination programs, strong arguments support implementation and prioritization of IMD vaccination programs; IMD cases have increased in some countries and IMD rates may even have exceeded pre-pandemic levels. Additional concerns include increased susceptibility due to vaccination coverage gaps, increased incidence of other respiratory pathogens, immunity debt from lockdown restrictions, and increased IMD epidemiologic variability. The full range of benefits of widely available and effective meningococcal vaccines needs to be considered, especially in health technology assessments, where the broad benefits of these vaccines are neither accurately quantified nor captured in implementation policy decisions. Importantly, implementation of meningococcal vaccination programs in the current IMD climate also appeals to broader healthcare principles, including preparedness rather than reactive approaches, generally accepted benefit-risk approaches to vaccination, historical precedent, and the World Health Organization's goal of defeating meningitis by 2030. Countries should therefore act swiftly to bolster existing meningococcal vaccination strategies to provide broad coverage across age groups and serogroups given the recent increases in IMD incidence.","David E Bloom, Paolo Bonanni, Federico Martinón-Torres, Peter C Richmond, Marco A P Safadi, David M Salisbury, Apostolos Charos, Katharina Schley, Jamie Findlow, Paul Balmer",Infectious diseases and therapy,2023,COVID-19; Epidemiology; Immunization programs; Incidence; Vaccines,10.1007/s40121-023-00888-w,"Harvard T.H.

38048020,Microbial interactions and the homeostasis of the gut microbiome: the role of ,"The human gut is home to trillions of microorganisms that influence several aspects of our health. This dense microbial community targets almost all dietary polysaccharides and releases multiple metabolites, some of which have physiological effects on the host. A healthy equilibrium between members of the gut microbiota, its microbial diversity, and their metabolites is required for intestinal health, promoting regulatory or anti-inflammatory immune responses. In contrast, the loss of this equilibrium due to antibiotics, low fiber intake, or other conditions results in alterations in gut microbiota composition, a term known as gut dysbiosis. This dysbiosis can be characterized by a reduction in health-associated microorganisms, such as butyrate-producing bacteria, enrichment of a small number of opportunistic pathogens, or a reduction in microbial diversity.

38046822,The Kynurenine/Tryptophan Ratio as a Promising Metabolomic Biomarker for Diagnosing the Spectrum of Tuberculosis Infection and Disease.,"The metabolic system and immunology used to be seen as distinct fields of study. Recent developments in our understanding of how the immune system operates in health and disease have connected these fields to complex systems. An effective technique for identifying probable abnormalities of metabolic homeostasis brought on by disease is metabolomics, which is defined as the thorough study of small molecule metabolic intermediates within a biological system that collectively make up the metabolome. A prognostic metabolic biomarker with adequate prognostic accuracy for tuberculosis progression has recently been created. The rate-limiting host enzyme for the conversion of tryptophan to kynurenine, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), is greatly elevated in the lungs of tuberculosis disease patients. Targeted study on tryptophan in tuberculosis disease indicates that such decreases may also resembled this upregulation. Although tuberculosis diagnosis has improved with the use of interferon release assay and tuberculosis nucleic acid amplification, tuberculosis control is made difficult by the lack of a biomarker to diagnose active tuberculosis disease. We hope that the reader of this work can develop an understanding of the advantages of metabolomics testing, particularly as a sort of testing that can be used for both diagnosing and monitoring a patient's response to treatment for tuberculosis.","Fitri Fadhilah, Agnes Rengga Indrati, Sumartini Dewi, Prayudi Santoso",International journal of general medicine,2023,K/T ratio; biomarker; metabolomic study; tuberculosis spectrum,10.2147/IJGM.S438364,"Doctorate in Medicine Program, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Padjadjaran, Bandung, West Java, Indonesia.; Clinical Pathology Department, Hasan Sadikin General Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Padjadjaran, Bandung, West Java, Indonesia.; Internal Medicine Department, Hasan Sadikin General Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Padjadjaran, Bandung, West Java, Indonesia.; Internal Medicine Department, Hasan Sadikin General Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Padjadjaran, Bandung, West Java, Indonesia.",N/A,N/A,Journal Article; Review
38045904,The discovery of aryl-2-nitroethyl triamino pyrimidines as anti-Trypanosoma brucei agents.,"Pteridine reductase 1 (PTR1) is a catalytic protein belonging to the folate metabolic pathway in Trypanosmatidic parasites. PTR1 is a known target for the medicinal chemistry development of antiparasitic agents against Trypanosomiasis and Leishmaniasis. In previous studies, new nitro derivatives were elaborated as PTR1 inhibitors. The compounds showing a diamino-pyrimidine core structure were previously developed but they showed limited efficacy. Therefore, a new class of phenyl-, heteroaryl- and benzyloxy-nitro derivatives based on the 2-nitroethyl-2,4,6-triaminopyrimidine scaffold were designed and tested. The compounds were assayed for their ability to inhibit T. brucei and L. major PTR1 enzymes and for their antiparasitic activity towards T. brucei and L. infantum parasites. To understand the structure-activity relationships of the compounds against TbPTR1, the X-ray crystallographic structure of the 2,4,6-triaminopyrimidine (TAP) was obtained and molecular modelling studies were performed. As a next step, only the most effective compounds against T. brucei were then tested against the amastigote cellular stage of T. cruzi, searching for a broad-spectrum antiprotozoal agent. An early ADME-Tox profile evaluation was performed. The early toxicity profile of this class of compounds was investigated by measuring their inhibition of hERG and five cytochrome P450 isoforms (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4), cytotoxicity towards A549 cells and mitochondrial toxicity. Pharmacokinetic studies (SNAP-PK) were performed on selected compounds using hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrins (50 % w/v) to preliminarily study their plasma concentration when administered per os at a dose of 20 mg/kg. Compound 1p, showed the best pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties, can be considered a good candidate for further bioavailability and efficacy studies.","Pasquale Linciano, Cecilia Pozzi, Giusy Tassone, Giacomo Landi, Stefano Mangani, Matteo Santucci, Rosaria Luciani, Stefania Ferrari, Nuno Santarem, Lorenzo Tagliazucchi, Anabela Cordeiro-da-Silva, Michele Tonelli, Donatella Tondi, Laura Bertarini, Sheraz Gul, Gesa Witt, Carolina B Moraes, Luca Costantino, Maria Paola Costi",European journal of medicinal chemistry,2024,Antiparasitic agents; Drug discovery; Leishmania infantum; Pteridine reductase; Trypanosoma brucei,10.1016/j.ejmech.2023.115946,"Department of Life Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Via Campi 103, 41125, Modena, Italy.; Department of Biotechnology, Chemistry and Pharmacy, University of Siena, Via Aldo Moro 2, 53100, Siena, Italy; Institute for Research and Innovation in Health (i3S), University of Porto, 4200-135 Porto, Portugual.; Department of Biotechnology, Chemistry and Pharmacy, University of Siena, Via Aldo Moro 2, 53100, Siena, Italy.; Department of Biotechnology, Chemistry and Pharmacy, University of Siena, Via Aldo Moro 2, 53100, Siena, Italy.; Department of Biotechnology, Chemistry and Pharmacy, University of Siena, Via Aldo Moro 2, 53100, Siena, Italy.; Department of Life Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Via Campi 103, 41125, Modena, Italy.; Department of Life Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Via Campi 103, 41125, Modena, Italy.; Department of Life Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Via Campi 103, 41125, Modena, Italy.; Institute for Research and Innovation in Health (i3S), University of Porto, 4200-135 Porto, Portugual; Laboratory of Microbiology, Department of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Porto, Rua de Jorge ViterboFerreira 228, 4050-313 Porto, Portugal.; Department of Life Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Via Campi 103, 41125, Modena, Italy; Clinical and Experimental Medicine (CEM) PhD Program, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Via Campi 278, 41125, Modena, Italy.; Institute for Research and Innovation in Health (i3S), University of Porto, 4200-135 Porto, Portugual; Laboratory of Microbiology, Department of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Porto, Rua de Jorge ViterboFerreira 228, 4050-313 Porto, Portugal.; Department of Pharmacy, University of Genoa, Viale Benedetto XV, 3, 16132, Genoa, Italy.; Department of Life Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Via Campi 103, 41125, Modena, Italy.; Department of Life Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Via Campi 103, 41125, Modena, Italy.; Fraunhofer Institute for Translational Medicine and Pharmacology ITMP, Hamburg, Germany; Fraunhofer Cluster of Excellence for Immune-Mediated Diseases CIMD, Hamburg, Germany.; Fraunhofer Institute for Translational Medicine and Pharmacology ITMP, Hamburg, Germany; Fraunhofer Cluster of Excellence for Immune-Mediated Diseases CIMD, Hamburg, Germany.; Laboratório Nacional de Biociências (LNBio), Centro Nacional de Pesquisa em Energia e Materiais (CNPEM), 13083-100, Campinas, SP, Brazil.; Department of Life Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Via Campi 103, 41125, Modena, Italy.; Department of Life Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Via Campi 103, 41125, Modena, Italy.

38043491,Immunometabolism of dendritic cells in health and disease.,"Dendritic cells (DCs) are crucial mediators that bridge the innate and adaptive immune responses. Cellular rewiring of metabolism is an emerging regulator of the activation, migration, and functional specialization of DC subsets in specific microenvironments and immunological conditions. DCs undergo metabolic adaptation to exert immunogenic or tolerogenic effects in different contexts. Also, beyond their intracellular metabolic and signaling roles, metabolites and nutrients mediate the intercellular crosstalk between DCs and other cell types, and such crosstalk orchestrates DC function and immune responses. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of the metabolic regulation of DC biology in various contexts and summarize the current understanding of such regulation in directing immune homeostasis and inflammation, specifically with respect to infections, autoimmunity, tolerance, cancer, metabolic diseases, and crosstalk with gut microbes. Understanding context-specific metabolic alterations in DCs may identify mechanisms for physiological and pathological functions of DCs and yield potential opportunities for therapeutic targeting of DC metabolism in many diseases.","Chuansheng Guo, Hongbo Chi",Advances in immunology,2023,N/A,10.1016/bs.ai.2023.10.002,"Department of Immunology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, United States.; Department of Immunology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, United States.

38022598,Intestinal homeostasis in the gut-lung-kidney axis: a prospective therapeutic target in immune-related chronic kidney diseases.,"In recent years, the role of intestinal homeostasis in health has received increasing interest, significantly improving our understanding of the complex pathophysiological interactions of the gut with other organs. Microbiota dysbiosis, impaired intestinal barrier, and aberrant intestinal immunity appear to contribute to the pathogenesis of immune-related chronic kidney diseases (CKD). Meanwhile, the relationship between the pathological changes in the respiratory tract (e.g., infection, fibrosis, granuloma) and immune-related CKD cannot be ignored. The present review aimed to elucidate the new underlying mechanism of immune-related CKD. The lungs may affect kidney function through intestinal mediation. Communication is believed to exist between the gut and lung microbiota across long physiological distances. Following the inhalation of various pathogenic factors (e.g., particulate matter 2.5 mum or less in diameter, pathogen) in the air through the mouth and nose, considering the anatomical connection between the nasopharynx and lungs, gut microbiome regulates oxidative stress and inflammatory states in the lungs and kidneys. Meanwhile, the intestine participates in the differentiation of T cells and promotes the migration of various immune cells to specific organs. This better explain the occurrence and progression of CKD caused by upper respiratory tract precursor infection and suggests the relationship between the lungs and kidney complications in some autoimmune diseases (e.g., anti-neutrophil cytoplasm antibodies -associated vasculitis, systemic lupus erythematosus). CKD can also affect the progression of lung diseases (e.g., acute respiratory distress syndrome and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). We conclude that damage to the gut barrier appears to contribute to the development of immune-related CKD through gut-lung-kidney interplay, leading us to establish the gut-lung-kidney axis hypothesis. Further, we discuss possible therapeutic interventions and targets. For example, using prebiotics, probiotics, and laxatives (e.g., Rhubarb officinale) to regulate the gut ecology to alleviate oxidative stress, as well as improve the local immune system of the intestine and immune communication with the lungs and kidneys.","Xinyin Liu, Xiaoran Wang, Peipei Zhang, Yiwen Fang, Yanyan Liu, Yueyue Ding, Wen Zhang",Frontiers in immunology,2023,chronic kidney disease; gut-lung-kidney axis; immunity; intestinal homeostasis; microbiome,10.3389/fimmu.2023.1266792,"Department of Nephrology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University (Zhejiang Provincial Hospital of Chinese Medicine), Hangzhou, China.; Department of Nephrology, The First People's Hospital of Hangzhou Lin'an District, Hangzhou, China.; Department of Nephrology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University (Zhejiang Provincial Hospital of Chinese Medicine), Hangzhou, China.; The First Clinical Medical College, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, China.; Department of Geriatric, Zhejiang Aged Care Hospital, Hangzhou, China.; Department of Geriatric, Tongde Hospital of Zhejiang Province, Hangzhou, China.; Department of Nephrology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University (Zhejiang Provincial Hospital of Chinese Medicine), Hangzhou, China.","Humans; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; Kidney; Prebiotics; Anti-Neutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibody-Associated Vasculitis; Homeostasis; Lung",N/A,"Journal Article; Review; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

Current clinical practice recommendations advise a 2-4 week trial of maternal cow's milk dietary elimination for: a) IgE-mediated cow's milk allergy only if the infant is symptomatic on breastfeeding alone; b) non-IgE-mediated associated symptoms only if the history and examination strongly suggest cow's milk allergy; and c) infants with moderate to severe eczema/atopic dermatitis, unresponsive to topical steroids and sensitized to cow's milk protein. There should be a clear plan for home reintroduction of cow's milk into the maternal diet for a period of 1 week to determine that the cow's milk elimination is responsible for resolution of symptoms, and then subsequent reoccurrence of infant symptoms upon maternal cow's milk reintroduction. The evidence base to support the use of maternal cow's milk avoidance for the treatment of a breastfed infant with cow's milk allergy is of limited strength due to a lack of high-quality, adequately powered, randomised controlled trials. It is important to consider the consequences of maternal cow's milk avoidance on reducing immune enhancing factors in breast milk, as well as the potential nutritional and quality of life impacts on the mother. Referral to a dietitian is advised for dietary education, along with calcium and vitamin D supplementation according to local recommendations, and a maternal substitute milk should be advised. However, for most breastfed infants with cow's milk allergy maternal cow's milk dietary elimination will not be required, and active support of the mother to continue breastfeeding is essential.","Vicki McWilliam, Merryn J Netting, Evelyn Volders, Debra J Palmer",The World Allergy Organization journal,2023,Breastfeeding; IgE-mediated cow's milk allergy; Infant; Maternal nutrition; Non-IgE-mediated cow's milk allergy,10.1016/j.waojou.2023.100830,"Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Royal Children's Hospital, Parkville, VIC, Australia.; Women and Kids Theme, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute, Adelaide, SA, Australia.; Nutrition, Dietetics & Food, Monash University, Clayton, Vic, Australia.; Telethon Kids Institute, University of Western Australia, Nedlands, WA, Australia.",N/A,N/A,Journal Article
38020284,T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination are elevated in B cell deficiency and reduce risk of severe COVID-19.,"Individuals with primary and pharmacologic B cell deficiencies have high rates of severe disease and mortality from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but the immune responses and clinical outcomes after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and vaccination have yet to be fully defined. Here, we evaluate the cellular immune responses after both SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination in patients receiving the anti-CD20 therapy rituximab (RTX) and those with low B cell counts due to common variable immune deficiency (CVID) disease.
